The main caption of this related instructional poster reads, \"How should I behave during an air raid?\" Five captioned cartoons in the top row show what _not_ to do. Below each of these is the recommended life-saving response. \n\n1. \"Get away from the window!

After all, the Ukrainians are holding Russians. As far as I know, food as such is not in short supply in Russia. Was this the result of extreme mistreatment in one location? Or was it more widespread, systematic? Was it about torture with specific mission-related objectives? Was it zeal, resentment, sadism, corruption, indifference? Will this have any impact on Russian POWs in Ukraine? Or will Ukraine's leadership continue striving to keep the higher ground? \n",

				"content_html": "<p>The transition from Wordpress.com to Micro.blog was challenging because of the initial difficulty I had in finding and customizing a theme that worked for me. They either did not feel right to me, or I couldn&rsquo;t find sufficient documentation. This problem was multiplied by insufficient knowledge about Hugo (the blogging software) and Go (the language Hugo uses).</p>\n<p>I initially passed over Tiny Theme because I did not appreciate its developer&rsquo;s approach, but pouring through the Micro.blog help forums led me to try it again. Armed with a little more knowledge, I began to appreciate what the theme offers.</p>\n<p>Tiny Theme is the best-documented theme on Micro.blog. Besides the <a href=\"https://github.com/MattSLangford/Tiny-Theme-for-Micro.blog\">Git page</a>, its creator, <a href=\"https://mattlangford.com\">Matt Langford</a> has a dedicated <a href=\"https://tiny.micro.blog\">Tiny Theme site</a>, written in plain language that assumes some knowledge of blogging and markup, but not overly much.</p>\n<p>Matt also generously answers questions, but do your research first&mdash;both as a common courtesy and so you understand his answers.</p>\n<p>I think his &ldquo;leave a tip link&rdquo; recalls the great tradition of shareware, which Apple&rsquo;s app store has undermined in the MacOS world. Why not honor his work and keep such a tradition alive at the same time?</p>\n<h3 id=\"future-proofing\">Future-Proofing</h3>\n<p>The theme is built to be adaptable without changes requiring too many interventions in its core templates.

				"content_text": "The transition from Wordpress\\.com to Micro\\.blog was challenging because of the initial difficulty I had in finding and customizing a theme that worked for me. They either did not feel right to me, or I couldn't find sufficient documentation. This problem was multiplied by insufficient knowledge about Hugo (the blogging software) and Go (the language Hugo uses).\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI initially passed over Tiny Theme because I did not appreciate its developer's approach, but pouring through the Micro\\.blog help forums led me to try it again. Armed with a little more knowledge, I began to appreciate what the theme offers.\n\nTiny Theme is the best-documented theme on Micro\\.blog. Besides the [Git page](https://github.com/MattSLangford/Tiny-Theme-for-Micro.blog), its creator, [Matt Langford](https://mattlangford.com) has a dedicated [Tiny Theme site](https://tiny.micro.blog), written in plain language that assumes some knowledge of blogging and markup, but not overly much.\n\nMatt also generously answers questions, but do your research first---both as a common courtesy and so you understand his answers.\n\nI think his \"leave a tip link\" recalls the great tradition of shareware, which Apple's app store has undermined in the MacOS world. Why not honor his work and keep such a tradition alive at the same time?\n\n### Future-Proofing\n\nThe theme is built to be adaptable without changes requiring too many interventions in its core templates. One can still edit those, but Matt wrote the templates to look for a user's customizations in files called microhooks. This makes updating the theme much easier. \n\nUpdate-proofing matters because Matt regularly maintains and updates the theme (in useful ways, not ways that require you to rethink everything).\n\nIn this respect, it is better to use your Micro\\.blog custom CSS page than to change the theme's CSS directly. \n\nThis last point about CSS is critical for making a move to another theme possible. A lot of CSS customizations are specific to a theme, but you have some that are not theme-specific, e.g., [small image galleries](https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/12/small-image-galleries.html).\n\nIf you customize one of the theme's core templates (as opposed to the microhooks you write from scratch), write down what you did. You will need this information later. See below for your own customizations.\n\n### Updating Tiny Theme\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è When you see an update is available in Micro\\.blog's plugins UI (where the themes are stored), do not hit the update button. Instead, first go to Github to see which files have changed. (It's an easier UI for scanning modification dates.) Make a note of their names. Then hit the update button in the pugins UI.\n\n‚õîÔ∏è Never click the üîÑ button on the Micro\\.blog theme management page. Despite its emoji, it does **not** sync your files. It just downloads from the Github repository and overwrites your customized files, except the microhooks. You don't need this functionality, \n\nAfter that, your theme files in Micro\\.blog's theme editing UI (menu item: Design) will all still be intact. Below that section are the unedited theme files. If you have modified any of the files that that were updated, see the next step. Otherwise you're done (except to eyeball your blog for any apparent issues).\n\nAssuming you have taken notes on your modifications to any of the theme's templates that were updated, you first delete these modified files from the customization section, and then you modify and save the same changes in the section that holds the themes unmodified files. As soon as you do that, Micro\\.blog saves the file you your customized templates and restores the original template to the theme files section.\n\nThis setup relates to the lookup order of Micro\\.blog's Hugo rendering engine: It first looks if the necessary template is among the customized files. If it finds it, that's the one it uses to output that (part of the) page . If not, it looks to the original theme files. (If here either, it looks to Micro\\.blog's default files.)\n\n### My Modifications\n\nThis section does not include the microhooks, since the theme doesn't touch their contents.\n\n#### layouts/_default/list.html\n\nThis file renders category pages on Micro\\.blog. I merely added \"Category: \" before the page title (the category name) in the following block.\n\n```<h2 class=\"p-name\">Category: {{ .Title }}</h2>```\n#### layouts/_default/list.archivehtml.html\n\nThis is the template renders the archive page on Micro\\.blog, if you have enabled the page in Micro\\.blog's UI.\n\nMain issues with Tiny Theme default:\n\n1. The categories are not alphabetized.\n2. The categories render as a long vertical list.\n\nI needed alphabetical order and a format that worked better for all my categories than a vertical unordered list. (I have a lot of categories because Micro\\.blog is only set up for categories, not categories and tags.) \n\nTiny Theme has a microhook to add introductory material to the archive page, so that bit is not at issue here.\n\n#### Original section section of this theme page\n\n```\n<div class=\"archive-categories\">\n<h3>Categories</h3>\n<ul>\n{{ range $list }}\n<li><a href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\">{{ .Title }}</a></li>\n{{ end }}\n</ul>\n</div>\n{{ end }}\n```\n#### Modified section\n\nI was able to get most of the following by copying and pasting from a file in the notes of a short YouTube [video by Vlad Campos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un4vw1QscsY). I fooled around a lot with it,[^1] but I think I ended up just replacing the span tags with paragraph tags, which seems to have made CSS styling possible. (The indentation differences between this section and the original make no difference to Hugo, as far as I can tell.)\n\n```\n<div class=\"archive-categories\">\n<h3>Categories</h3>\n<p>\n{{ $sortedList := sort $list \"Title\" }}\n{{ $length := len $sortedList }}\n{{ range $index, $element := $sortedList }}\n<a href=\"{{ $element.Permalink }}\">{{ $element.Title }}</a>‚ÄÇ{{ if lt $index (sub $length 1) }}{{ end }} \n{{ end }}‚ÄÉ\n</p>\n</div>\n{{ end }}\n```\n#### Update (Oct. 10, 2024): Additional Modifications to Archive Page Template\n\nChange the `<p class=\"h-entry\">` block to the following:\n\n```\n<p class=\"h-entry\">\n<a href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\" class=\"u-url\"><span class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"{{ .Date.Format \"2006-01-02T15:04:05-0700\" }}\">{{ .Date.Format \"Jan 2, 2006\" }}</span></a> -¬†\n{{ if .Title }}\n<a href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\" class=\"u-url\"><span class=\"p-name\">{{ .Title }}</span></a>\n{{else}}\n<span class=\"p-summary\">{{ .Summary | truncate 140 }}</span>\n{{end}}\n</p>\n```\nThis changes the bold titles to normal font weight while also adding links to the titles. It also removes summaries from posts that have titles and truncates untitled posts at 140 characters.\n\n[^1]: I was fooling around with the sorting mechanism in the hope that I could retain a tags and categories distinction by prefacing each category name with an appropriate special character or emoji. When I did this, though, Hugo produced duplicates. I tried fixing that with the help of Hugo's documentation, but I never got anywhere.\n",

				"title": "What Can We Do about LLMs on Our Independent Websites?",
				"content_html": "<p>The following post appeared in my Mastodon timeline this morning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As of today, MacStories is disallowing all known AI crawlers, including ChatGPT and Applebot. If you want to read our site, you should use a web browser or RSS.<br>\n‚úåÔ∏è<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/112609519691842609\">Federico Viticci, June 13, 2023</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This pronouncement could, indeed, <em>is</em> being made by countless others who run independent websites. Questions and anxiety abound, but we are nowhere close to fashioning responses adequate to the current moment. A visceral sense of violation, of wrong, is hitting many of us, who have long since had enough of Silicon Valley, Madison Avenue, and all the rest treating the traces we leave online as a natural resource to extract value from. Yesterday, the above-quoted observer on Mastodon <a href=\"https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/112606317077490324#\">reported</a>, &ldquo;I was grossed out when I read that Applebot scraped &lsquo;the open web&rsquo; to train their AI model&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>My most immediate question about his no-AIs-on-MacStories statement was <em>how?</em> How you are working to keep <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model\">LLMs</a> from feasting on your site? Take the robots.txt file: Are there settings that allow search engines to index pages while instructing those same search engines that their LLM activities are not welcome? How do you cover all known LLMs and related scraping activities in a meaningful way? Aren&rsquo;t these things and their user numbers multiplying and mutating in ways that exceed our individual tracking abilities, not to mention <a href=\"https://www.searchenginecodex.com/proposing-a-new-meta-tag-for-llm-ai/\" title=\"Dena Mason, 'Proposing A New Meta Tag For LLM/AI'\">the limits</a> of what a robots.txt file can hold?</p>\n<p>Alternatively, have you found a way to make copyright and licensing statements that these tools will understand and honor? I&rsquo;m trying meta tags, but I think only the first of the two below is standard:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;meta name=&quot;author&quot; content=&quot;Mark R. Stoneman&quot;&gt;</code><br>\n<code>&lt;meta name=&quot;license&quot; content=&quot;CC BY-NC-SA 4.0&quot;&gt;</code></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also using semantic tags to ensure my copyright and CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license statements in the footer are easily discoverable, but it all feels so provisional, so early-2000s-wild-west again. Only worse.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the LLM challenge reaches beyond simple illegal copying, downloading, storage, and retrieval. These LLMs are being trained on our words, trained, it almost seems, by lurking in our conversations and learning. Their value proposition is that they will build something new on the basis of what already exists. Although this feels purely extractive (like Elsevier&rsquo;s contribution to academic publishing), how can such direct links between our individual output and that of the LLMs be established?</p>\n<p>Perhaps we are mixing feelings and concepts in ways that do not necessarily apply to the current situation. To begin with, there is that sense of personal violation that many of us have long felt with respect to the trackers that Google and other marketing entities use without our permission. The European Union&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/\">GDPR</a> is meant to address that problem for its citizenry, but the phenomenon of LLMs training on our language does not necessarily amount to an infringement of our data privacy&mdash;not if they are &ldquo;learning&rdquo; how to &ldquo;listen&rdquo; and &ldquo;talk&rdquo;, but not retaining data on our personal habits for later use. At the same time, this LLM scraping feels even creepier and more extractive than what advertising trackers were doing in the pre&ndash;LLM era.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m trying to imagine how we can regain a sense of control over the things we publish on the internet. We need practical web standards and tools that give us choices that the big LLM players are willing to respect. We need metaphors that reach beyond copyright and privacy, when necessary, but that don&rsquo;t lead us to anthropomorphize the LLMs and their &ldquo;learning&rdquo;, thereby making the problem of so-called AI even worse.

				"content_text": "\nThe following post appeared in my Mastodon timeline this morning:\n\n> As of today, MacStories is disallowing all known AI crawlers, including ChatGPT and Applebot. If you want to read our site, you should use a web browser or RSS.  \n> ‚úåÔ∏è  \n> <cite>[Federico Viticci, June 13, 2023](https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/112609519691842609)</cite>\n\nThis pronouncement could, indeed, _is_ being made by countless others who run independent websites. Questions and anxiety abound, but we are nowhere close to fashioning responses adequate to the current moment. A visceral sense of violation, of wrong, is hitting many of us, who have long since had enough of Silicon Valley, Madison Avenue, and all the rest treating the traces we leave online as a natural resource to extract value from. Yesterday, the above-quoted observer on Mastodon [reported](https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/112606317077490324#), \"I was grossed out when I read that Applebot scraped 'the open web' to train their AI model...\" \n<!--more-->\nMy most immediate question about his no-AIs-on-MacStories statement was _how?_ How you are working to keep [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) from feasting on your site? Take the robots.txt file: Are there settings that allow search engines to index pages while instructing those same search engines that their LLM activities are not welcome? How do you cover all known LLMs and related scraping activities in a meaningful way? Aren't these things and their user numbers multiplying and mutating in ways that exceed our individual tracking abilities, not to mention [the limits](https://www.searchenginecodex.com/proposing-a-new-meta-tag-for-llm-ai/ \"Dena Mason, 'Proposing A New Meta Tag For LLM/AI'\") of what a robots.txt file can hold? \n\nAlternatively, have you found a way to make copyright and licensing statements that these tools will understand and honor? I'm trying meta tags, but I think only the first of the two below is standard:\n\n`<meta name=\"author\" content=\"Mark R. Stoneman\">`  \n`<meta name=\"license\" content=\"CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\">`\n\nI'm also using semantic tags to ensure my copyright and CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license statements in the footer are easily discoverable, but it all feels so provisional, so early-2000s-wild-west again. Only worse.\n\nMoreover, the LLM challenge reaches beyond simple illegal copying, downloading, storage, and retrieval. These LLMs are being trained on our words, trained, it almost seems, by lurking in our conversations and learning. Their value proposition is that they will build something new on the basis of what already exists. Although this feels purely extractive (like Elsevier's contribution to academic publishing), how can such direct links between our individual output and that of the LLMs be established?\n\nPerhaps we are mixing feelings and concepts in ways that do not necessarily apply to the current situation. To begin with, there is that sense of personal violation that many of us have long felt with respect to the trackers that Google and other marketing entities use without our permission. The European Union's [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) is meant to address that problem for its citizenry, but the phenomenon of LLMs training on our language does not necessarily amount to an infringement of our data privacy---not if they are \"learning\" how to \"listen\" and \"talk\", but not retaining data on our personal habits for later use. At the same time, this LLM scraping feels even creepier and more extractive than what advertising trackers were doing in the pre--LLM era.\n \nI'm trying to imagine how we can regain a sense of control over the things we publish on the internet. We need practical web standards and tools that give us choices that the big LLM players are willing to respect. We need metaphors that reach beyond copyright and privacy, when necessary, but that don't lead us to anthropomorphize the LLMs and their \"learning\", thereby making the problem of so-called AI even worse. And we need jurisprudence that looks for ways to deal with our sense of violation that privacy laws and copyright alone do not seem adequate for. Meanwhile companies that use our linguistic existences to sell language-based LLM services back to us would do well to listen to their critics and adjust their activities accordingly. Wrapping up everything in pretty privacy policies and new feature hype will not be enough for them to thrive, although their deep pockets will help buy the legal frameworks they want, if we're not paying attention.\n",

I&rsquo;m not looking for greener pastures, but I&rsquo;m curious about what&rsquo;s on offer now, and I want to find some of the people who I don&rsquo;t see on Mastodon. Juggling social media platforms is inconvenient, but seemingly unavoidable at this particular moment, as people search for new communities and rebuild parts of their old ones. It is a moment of flux, and such flux could very well be the new normal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-twitter-that-was\">The Twitter that Was</h3>\n<p>Among the growing circles of people who have quit the place once called Twitter, discussions about the new platforms tend to occur in reference to the old place, if only implicitly. But characterizing that old place is not as straightforward as one might think. Before the recent ill-considered <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/07/musk-rushes-out-new-twitter-logo-its-just-an-x-that-someone-tweeted-at-him/\" title=\"Musk rushes out new Twitter logo‚Äîit‚Äôs just an X that someone tweeted at him\">rebranding</a> to X, Twitter was already different things to different people, depending not only on individual preferences but also on Twitter&rsquo;s possibilities. Those changed a great deal over the platform&rsquo;s first fifteen years, evolving in a synergy between users and developers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag\">Hashtags</a> were first employed by users as a way to organize and find posts. They also became tools for community-building. (Katrina Gulliver started using #twitterstorians back when historians' numbers there were relatively modest, for example, and this enabled us to find each other.) Quote tweets arose from user efforts to editorialize about others' posts. And threads, multipart tweets known earlier as tweetstorms, helped make such bursts of text easier to read in the order intended by the author. As Twitter adopted or initiated such features, they assumed different roles in users' practices and expectations, depending not only on users' needs and preferences but also on when they first adopted Twitter.</p>\n<p>In the early days, independent developers improved the Twitter experience with third-party mobile and desktop applications that offered features Twitter did not, or they implemented functionalities differently. It was also possible to follow what was happening by using an older internet protocol called RSS, the same thing one can still use to follow blogs and other sites in a newsreader (I use <a href=\"https://netnewswire.com\" title=\"A free open-source Mac and iOS app\">NetNewsWire</a>). And services emerged to let one stitch a series of posts into a single story. Blogging and other content management systems worked out ways to integrate users' activities with Twitter, and automation services such as IFTTT and Zapier made it possible to set up recipes that were triggered in the event of certain content. One could use a specific hashtag in a tweet, and that hashtag would trigger an IFTTT recipe to post the same thing on Facebook. There were also bots, little applications that could pull data from somewhere, including Twitter, and post to Twitter themselves, acting openly as bots or masquerading as real people. Coders created bots for fun and bots for good, but also bots that served grifters and the spread of disinformation.</p>\n<p>Twitter&rsquo;s open <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API\">API</a> made this diverse range of activity and user experiences possible. Its now prohibitively priced API has meant the death of most third-party applications and services.</p>\n<p>As people leave xitter, they are searching for different things and reacting to other platforms accordingly.

But they are also looking for specific features, the kind that can help them to approximate their earlier experiences, or even improve on them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-apps-i-use\">The Apps I Use</h3>\n<p>In my case, a crucial aspect of the features question is how well each platform dovetails with my established routines on the iPad and Mac. Specifically, I am interested in integration with third-party apps and services for composition, crossposting, and syndication. I also want good apps for the specific social media platforms I&rsquo;m on. And I want a choice in the matter, like I used to have with Twitter before Musk started to reshape his newly purchased realm into a walled-off dystopia.</p>\n<p>I have come to like Mastodon so much in part because <a href=\"https://tapbots.com\">Tapbots</a> was so fast to release and refine a Mastodon client called <strong>Ivory</strong> (iOS and Mac). Having used this small company‚Äôs excellent <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/\">Tweetbot</a> for at least a decade, I felt at home in Ivory right away, much more so than in the other Mastodon apps I tried.</p>\n<p>Another helpful app that I have used for many years is <strong>Linky</strong> by <a href=\"https://pragmaticcode.com\">Pragmatic Code</a>. An iOS app that is available through the system&rsquo;s share extension from within Safari, it lets me post a link and select the accompanying image or images I want. Adding <a href=\"https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/describe-content-images\">alt text</a> to each image for those who use a <a href=\"https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-products/screen-readers\">screen reader</a> is also easy.

In fact, if you know how to write scripts, you could probably create an action that posts directly to Bluesky because that platform, like Mastodon, is open-source, albeit with a different, less mature internet protocol.</p>\n<h3 id=\"diversity-of-platforms\">Diversity of Platforms</h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s still early days in this post-xitter world, so I&rsquo;ll talk about the kinds of people I&rsquo;m finding and interactions I&rsquo;m having another time. Only one thing is already clear: Many of the academics I used to follow are happy with Mastodon, but they don&rsquo;t necessarily use the same tools I do. Many others are still hopping about, trying the different places, and sometimes even keeping xitter in the mix. Based on the behavior and comments I&rsquo;m seeing, I suspect there will no longer be a single, one-size-fits-all-in-countless-different-ways platform of the kind the old bird place had become.

				"content_text": "<p>The new owner of Twitter is behaving in a way that has forced me to make a decision. Can I, in good conscience, continue to produce content that earns ad revenue for a man who is now working to normalize transphobic, antisemitic, racist, misogynistic, fascistic speech and other kinds of dangerous hate and disinformation? I know how to survive and even thrive while blocking out the worst of these things, but do I want to be part of such an ecosystem? It's clear now that the chief twit knows what he is doing. He is gaslighting us with his \"free speech\" and \"transparency\" rhetoric, and I've had enough.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>I am angry that Twitter is being ruined in such fashion, and I feel the poorer for its loss. Twitter is where I first learned about Trayvon Martin's murder‚Äîseveral days before the newspaper mentioned it. I only had access to this news because of the overlap between academic Twitter and Black Twitter among the people I was following. (This was before the site's algorithm began to shape people's timelines, a feature I resisted adopting.) Many years later, the place served as a lifeline during the multiple crises of 2020: covid, murderous police violence uncovered again, the seeming attempt of an unhinged president to bring martial law to DC, and then the conspiracy to overthrow the results of the 2020 election.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter helped many of us to overcome the crippling effects of isolation in this never-ending pandemic because, at its best, it facilitated conversation. Along the way, it introduced me to disaster, public health, and disability scholars, including historians, and to disability Twitter more generally. Most recently, the platform has been extremely important for finding experts and reliable information about Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the West's response. As a result, I have grown all too aware that not only does the European history I know need decolonizing (one clear consequence of the Black Lives Matter movement) but the Imperial Russian and Soviet history I learned in graduate school does too.</p>\n<p>Across all of these topics, I have benefited from contact with ordinary engaged citizens. Twitter was never just about expert discourses. In fact, sometimes the information I sought had to do with things in my own neighborhood, such as a power outage, snowstorm, or possible explanations for the appearance of emergency vehicles.</p>\n<p>Saying goodbye to Twitter is possible because I've already been able to connect with historians, in particular, on Mastodon, although reaching beyond them will take longer. At the same time, there are plenty of important voices still on Twitter, not least those from Ukraine. That's why I'm keeping my scrubbed account there for reading only, not conversing.</p>\n<p>I posted a few notes about <a href=\"https://markstoneman.com/2022/11/23/mastodon/\">Mastodon</a> a little over a week ago. If anyone is interested in trying it out, there's a new instance run by historians called <a href=\"https://historians.social\">historians.social</a>. It was started by professional historians, but they are explicitly welcoming all who are working in or otherwise engaged with history. By the way, starting on Mastodon is only as hard or easy as you make it. My advice is just to dive in and then learn the options and features by doing. Don't worry about finding the perfect instance either because it's easy to move. But do read the rules because moderation varies across instances.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In my initial academic encounters with Germany in the late 1980s and early 1990s, one of the things that impressed me was the availability of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->handbooks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as well as specialized encyclopedias such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The textbook series <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oldenbourg Grundriss der Geschichte<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was a new experience for me.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Each volume offered a concise, chronologically organized survey (with key terms in the margins for rapid orientation), followed by a substantial historiographical discussion and bibliography. At the time, I did not appreciate the massive effort behind such compilation and systematization efforts. I just found these tools were quite practical for orienting myself in a given historical subject. Why didn&rsquo;t we have such useful tools in the United States?</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I do know that my doctoral advisor&rsquo;s approach to reading lists for our comprehensive exams at Georgetown University in the mid-to-late 1990s was unusual in the history department there. Roger Chickering gave us a massive bibliography for research purposes along with a so-called canon (read: very long list) of the texts that he expected every PhD student to know or at least know about.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> For my reading in Soviet, Imperial Russian, modern French, and modern British history, I had to write up my own reading lists, sometimes with suggestions by the professor, never with the ambitious, perhaps Sisyphean intention of producing a canon.</p>\n<p>Roger Chickering, of course, is both product and producer of the American academic landscape, and he has deep ties in the German one too. The above example, however, is not meant to suggest that his approach was in any way related to its proximity to German academic culture. Instead, I mention it in order to underline what I sense is an additional reason for the (to my mind) weaker handbook culture in the United States, at least among historians. Such systematization is hard and its desirability not clear.</p>\n<p>The nice thing about this blog is that it does not require massive overhead, although it does seem to have some institutional support. Nor must an entire handbook be conceived and created before anyone can use the knowledge being gathered and produced for it. The blog simply grows over time (since 2011) and can respond to new concerns and concentrations with tweaks to its categories and tags.</p>\n<p>I bring this up because I was struck by a recent post on the francophone blog <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Germano-Fil<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a Franco-German production. The post is entitled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚ÄúRecherche bibliographique en France et en Allemagne‚Äù<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and contains a wonderfully useful list of resources, the kind I would like to have had when I was studying German history. This list would also fit in one of the more traditional handbooks, but it is on a blog and can be accessed easily via the site&rsquo;s category links, which act like a table of contents. Does such a detailed resource even exist in English for the study of German history? Hard to imagine.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Another site, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->historicum.net<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is a cross between a reference work and a reference library for students of history. Such an undertaking, of course, requires substantial institutional support, at least that is the impression I get from the extensive content, not to mention the logos of the project&rsquo;s sponsors‚Äîthe Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Universit√§t K√∂ln, and the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Docupedia-Zeitgeshichte<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> also recalls a multivolume handbook with a correspondingly large editorial team. Like on GHDI and <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->historicum.net<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Docupedia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s articles contain no tags or links to establish connections across entries. Instead, each piece reads like a traditional handbook article.

				"content_text": "<p class=\"callout\">First published on <a href=\"https://historyofknowledge.net/2017/02/03/organizing-and-communicating-historical-knowledge-some-personal-observations/\">History of Knowledge</a>, February 3, 2017</p>\n\nIn my initial academic encounters with Germany in the late 1980s and early 1990s, one of the things that impressed me was the availability of <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9783423046336\">handbooks</a> as well as specialized encyclopedias such as <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geschichtliche_Grundbegriffe\">Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe</a>. The textbook series <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?ds=20&kn=Oldenbourg+Grundriss+der+Geschichte&sts=t\">Oldenbourg Grundriss der Geschichte</a> was a new experience for me.<a id=\"fnref-878-1\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-878-1\"><sup>1</sup></a> Each volume offered a concise, chronologically organized survey (with key terms in the margins for rapid orientation), followed by a substantial historiographical discussion and bibliography. At the time, I did not appreciate the massive effort behind such compilation and systematization efforts. I just found these tools were quite practical for orienting myself in a given historical subject. Why didn't we have such useful tools in the United States?\n\n<p style=\"line-height:1.6\">Nowadays, it seems pretty clear to me that the difference had to do with how academic projects are organized and funded, and how their merits are perceived when hiring decisions are made. Perhaps, too, there is something in the academic culture that sees particular value in such projects, although I have no idea how one would separate such possible cultural predilections from the institutional organization of scholarship generally and of the discipline of history more specifically.\n\nI do know that my doctoral advisor's approach to reading lists for our comprehensive exams at Georgetown University in the mid-to-late 1990s was unusual in the history department there. Roger Chickering gave us a massive bibliography for research purposes along with a so-called canon (read: very long list) of the texts that he expected every PhD student to know or at least know about.<a id=\"fnref-878-2\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-878-2\"><sup>2</sup></a> For my reading in Soviet, Imperial Russian, modern French, and modern British history, I had to write up my own reading lists, sometimes with suggestions by the professor, never with the ambitious, perhaps Sisyphean intention of producing a canon.\n\nRoger Chickering, of course, is both product and producer of the American academic landscape, and he has deep ties in the German one too. The above example, however, is not meant to suggest that his approach was in any way related to its proximity to German academic culture. Instead, I mention it in order to underline what I sense is an additional reason for the (to my mind) weaker handbook culture in the United States, at least among historians. Such systematization is hard and its desirability not clear.\n\nThe nice thing about this blog is that it does not require massive overhead, although it does seem to have some institutional support. Nor must an entire handbook be conceived and created before anyone can use the knowledge being gathered and produced for it. The blog simply grows over time (since 2011) and can respond to new concerns and concentrations with tweaks to its categories and tags.\n\nI bring this up because I was struck by a recent post on the francophone blog <a href=\"http://germano-fil.hypotheses.org\"><em>Germano-Fil</em></a>, a Franco-German production. The post is entitled <a href=\"http://germano-fil.hypotheses.org/2370\">‚ÄúRecherche bibliographique en France et en Allemagne‚Äù</a> and contains a wonderfully useful list of resources, the kind I would like to have had when I was studying German history. This list would also fit in one of the more traditional handbooks, but it is on a blog and can be accessed easily via the site's category links, which act like a table of contents. Does such a detailed resource even exist in English for the study of German history? Hard to imagine.</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.6\">There are other German websites that mirror the old handbook and encyclopedia culture more closely in that they are the products of specific research grants, and they begin with a structure, like a book, instead of waiting for a structure to emerge, as is possible on a blog. In its current iteration, <a href=\"http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org\"><em>German History in Documents and Images (GHDI)</em></a>, a German‚ÄìNorth American project, is organized in chronologically bounded volumes, each edited by a different historian (or team of historians).\n\nAnother site, <a href=\"https://www.historicum.net/home/\">historicum.net</a>, is a cross between a reference work and a reference library for students of history. Such an undertaking, of course, requires substantial institutional support, at least that is the impression I get from the extensive content, not to mention the logos of the project's sponsors‚Äîthe Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Universit√§t K√∂ln, and the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.docupedia.de/\"><em>Docupedia-Zeitgeshichte</em></a> also recalls a multivolume handbook with a correspondingly large editorial team. Like on GHDI and <a href=\"https://www.historicum.net/home\"><em>historicum.net</em></a>, <em>Docupedia</em>'s articles contain no tags or links to establish connections across entries. Instead, each piece reads like a traditional handbook article. In other words, the enterprise comports with the traditional research and writing practices of professional historians.\n\nI have been thinking about blogs in terms of academic cultures for another reason as well. The above-mentioned blog has an <a href=\"http://www.issn.org/understanding-the-issn/what-is-an-issn/\">ISSN</a>, an identifier for periodicals. My encounters with academic blogs in the past decade or so have not involved this kind of identifier.

				"content_text": "<p>We tried something new in connection with a conference called <a href=\"https://historyofknowledge.net/lbtb/\">Learning by the Book</a>. The conveners asked participants to submit a blog post to <em><a href=\"https://historyofknowledge.net\">History of Knowledge</a></em> in lieu of precirculated papers. One of the conveners, my colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kerstinvdkrone\">Kerstin von der Krone</a>, did most of the coordinating work, prescreening posts for length, permissions issues, and content. Then I edited them, trying to ensure they spoke to a multidisciplinary audience, not just specialists in their authors' respective fields.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Of thirty-seven potential posts, we managed to publish thirty-five on a rolling basis between May 2 and June 5. Four of these were crossposted on the <em><a href=\"https://recipes.hypotheses.org\">Recipes Project</a></em> and edited by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JessicaPClark\">Jess Clark</a> instead of me. One piece wasn't published because of an unresolved copyright issue and another because the author had trouble conceiving of a short blog post that spoke directly to the conference's concerns while giving the original research context a much more cursory treatment. These numbers tell a success story. An overwhelming number of scholars, from graduate students to senior scholars, were able‚Äîand willing‚Äîto convey their core ideas in only 1,000 to 2,000 words. And they did so to good effect.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, scholars will read aloud what they precirculated to conference participants. I experienced only half the conference in person, but the papers I heard generally did not duplicate the blog posts. Some presenters made their blog contributions a foundation on which to build fuller versions of their posts, while others consciously used the blog format to present a specific aspect of their work, presenting other sides of the story in the conference room. A great example of the latter strategy was offered by <a href=\"https://history.princeton.edu/people/jennifer-m-rampling\">Jennifer Rampling</a>, whose <a href=\"https://historyofknowledge.net/2018/05/24/how-to-sublime-mercury-reading-like-a-philosopher-in-medieval-europe/\">blog post</a> focused on an alchemic experiment in the lab, but whose talk dove into the alchemy manuscripts and how they were read.</p>\n<p>One participant also suggested that blogging before conferencing forced participants to prepare better because their ideas were being made public in advance. Moreover, the process of writing and revising can force one to become clearer about one's own positions.</p>\n<p>The higher volume of activity on <em><a href=\"https://historyofknowledge.net\">History of Knowledge</a></em> lead it to garner many times its normal number of readers, thereby expanding the reach of the conference, getting ideas to an audience many times its size. Conclusions synthesizing the results are missing, of course, but what a way to get a first draft! If all history is an act of interpretation, why not make earlier iterations of that work public for other scholars and for engaged members of the public?</p>\n<p>Reader engagement (visible in visitor statistics and in reader engagement with our accompanying <a href=\"https://twitter.com/histknowledge\">Twitter posts</a>) and the discussions at the conference itself underlined that knowledge as an object of historical inquiry can open productive dialog across seemingly impermeable disciplinary and sub-disciplinary boundaries. (Researching what hashtags to use for which communities on Twitter helps too.)</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://mrstoneman.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5144f7334b.jpg\" alt=\"Detail from ‚ÄúCombat at the military station: Of Chateau d‚Äô Eau, 24th February 1848 / combat au poste: Du Ch√¢teau d‚Äô Eau, 24 F√©vr. 1848\"></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>If military service had become a rite of passage for young men in much of Europe well before the mutual slaughter began in the summer of 1914, neither its ubiquity nor its meaning to those it embraced were foregone conclusions. To be sure, the fundamental challenge offered by the declaration of the lev√©e en masse in revolutionary France in 1793 represented an important first step, as did monarchical Prussia‚Äôs turn in 1813 to the near-general conscription of those men considered young and fit enough to join the fight. Indeed, Prussia‚Äôs response to the Napoleonic challenge intertwined military service, citizenship, and manhood in the gendered construction of a nation at war that bore a striking resemblance to those ideals manifest in the mobilizations of 1914.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> Nonetheless, near-universal manhood conscription took many more decades to predominate on the continent (never mind the United Kingdom, which did not resort to it until 1916).<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, the path was not at all direct, not from the state‚Äôs and army‚Äôs side nor from the general population‚Äôs. For the state and its military leadership, big citizens‚Äô armies could be desirable for fighting a foreign enemy, but they could also present a threat to the domestic-political status quo because they might not allow themselves to be used to suppress protest or insurrection at home. A further decisive factor was technology and how military leaders came to use it. Especially important were the railroads and the development of strategic thought and organizational structures that placed a premium on mobilizing large numbers of men at once for a decisive blow of the kind Helmuth von Moltke pulled off for Prussia at K√∂niggr√§tz (aka Sadowa) in 1866 and at Sedan in 1870 during the wars that produced a German nation-state.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Of course, an approach to war of this kind also required large numbers of trained conscripts and experienced reservists. But first things first. The men targeted by conscription (and then the reserves) and the families and communities in which they had been raised first needed to learn to see the state‚Äôs call to the colors as legitimate and inescapable, let alone perceive value in the prospect.</p>\n<p>Nineteenth-century discourses and attitudes regarding conscription were informed by normative assumptions about manhood in connection with a wide range of topics‚Äîcivic or national duty and martial sacrifice, forbearance and manliness, masculinity and bravery, willpower and human flesh versus modern weaponry (especially later in the century), the impact of length of service on soldiers‚Äô relationship to civilian society, civilian upbringings and soldiers‚Äô political reliability, the reputational impact of military service on veterans returning to civilian life, and so on. The gendered matrix of military service and citizenship was integral to warfare and its sociopolitical effects in Europe. This matrix is the subject of the first of three thematic sections comprising this [unrealized] chapter. Ordinary men in uniform occupy the center of this analysis, but other men and women who joined or supported the armed struggles‚Äîinterstate and intrastate‚Äîare also considered.</p>\n<p>The importance and meaning of conscription in this period was also affected by the increasing cachet of nationality as an organizing principle for the European state system, or at least as a cultural manifestation that states could leverage.<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup> Whether in the ranks as conscripts, as substitutes for conscripts, as wartime volunteers, or by vocation, soldiers were beginning to be identified‚Äîand even identify themselves, at least in wartime‚Äîwith the nation-state or the national cause that they served. Many fought in conflicts that had national resonance among the general population, such as the Crimean War (1853‚Äì56), and many others fought in wars that led to the creation of the Italian and German nation-states (achieved in 1861 and 1871, respectively). The last case also entailed the national humiliation of France‚Äîwidely felt in that country‚Äîin a series of disastrous defeats (1870‚Äì71).</p>\n<p>These conflicts did not just involve soldiers in the service of the state, however. The rise of nationality and ‚Äúthe people‚Äù as relevant factors saw men (and even women) join irregular formations to attain their national goals or, in the case of Italy, at least redeem their nation‚Äôs honor, whether that meant overturning a foreign or particularistic ruler (especially during the European revolutions of 1848) or defending their nation against a foreign invader or dying in the attempt. Or so the nationalist narratives went, even if some probably took up arms to defend their home and locality against the privations of requisitioning and marauding.</p>\n<p>These decades also saw men and women (and youth) in cities resort to violence in order to change constitutional structures or protest economic and social conditions.<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">5</a></sup> Whether or not any military experience was involved in the barricade building of 1848, memories of earlier revolts had certainly been passed down to the frequently subaltern generations of that time, a legacy that was also evident during the Paris Commune‚Äôs struggle in 1871.<sup id=\"fnref:6\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">6</a></sup> Intertwined with implicit and explicit discourses about citizenship and belonging‚Äîand thus about manhood and womanhood, too‚Äîthese episodes also belonged to the complex, often violent process of nation formation and consolidation. At the same time, in this context of nation-making wars and insurrections, the seemingly contradictory phenomenon of international volunteers serving a national cause must also be considered.<sup id=\"fnref:7\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">7</a></sup></p>\n<p>The circles of social actors and norms to potentially include in a gendered analysis of the above mentioned wars and insurrections could be expanded a great deal further, if space constraints and available research permitted it. Whenever gender played a role in constructing or understanding the motivation and practices of those fighting, that role conceptually comprised both masculinity and femininity because gender, like class and race, is a relational concept. If the military world had become almost exclusively male and masculine in the nineteenth century, that manhood still presupposed relationships with women and femininity.</p>\n<p>Normative femininity might be embodied in the appearance and comportment of women accompanying the army (in France, holdovers like the cantin√®re) or nursing the wounded (in the Crimea, Mary Seacole and Florence Nightingale). There were also the women at home for whom one fought, or the girl one intended to marry after completing active duty. Normative images of women in the minds of soldiers could affect those soldiers‚Äô reactions to encounters with women in wartime, in the course of requisitioning food from civilians or sleeping in civilians‚Äô homes or outbuildings‚Äîor when fighting irregulars or taking a town street by street. Finally, a siege army could not make distinctions between soldiers and civilians, men and woman, adults and children in a besieged city (as in the Prussian-German siege of Paris in 1870‚Äì71). On the other hand, policy decisions reached in the besieged city itself (or policy lacunae) could create great differences‚Äîbetween rich and poor, soldiers and civilians (and therefore also between men and women), and so on.</p>\n<p>No matter how powerful memories of the lev√©e en masse continued to be in the middle decades of nineteenth century France, to take the most famous example of a nation in arms, patriotism and √©lan were not enough to win wars. One also needed professional expertise to train and lead men in war or in the suppression of an insurrection. With different educational levels and frequently a more elevated social background, officers might well embody masculinity differently than the men in their charge, especially if they were noblemen. Furthermore, as military technologies grew and military organizations became more complex, the knowledge required by at least some of the officers expanded. As the job changed, so too could the men doing it.</p>\n<p>These developments were accompanied by public and internal debates about military leadership. What qualities did officers require? From which stock was recruitment most desirable? What training did they require? What was their relationship to their men supposed to look like? How did they treat their subordinates? And what about their relationship to acknowledged social equals and supposed inferiors‚Äîespecially men‚Äîoutside the military? How did their expertise and comportment figure into their practice of masculinity and its reception? What did military service and sacrifice mean to these men? How did social background and family history shape that meaning? Finally, what about their private lives? How did marriage and family fit into their military careers? To what extent did the bourgeois ideal of a separate domestic sphere obtain in this context? Of course, each of these questions could lead to more than one answer because officer corps were by no means homogeneous.<sup id=\"fnref:8\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">8</a></sup> Furthermore, some important military leaders did not fit within this framework at all, most prominently Giuseppe Garibaldi, whose biography, relationship to his fighters, and influential public image form an instructive counterpoint.<sup id=\"fnref:9\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">9</a></sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, if soldiers were citizens acting on behalf of the nation, their actions might be expected to bear a closer relationship to the values and norms that guided their behavior in civilian life. Actual or alleged practices in wartime that appeared contrary to the predominant normative conception of war‚Äîstill largely informed by the metaphor of a dual between two equal and honorable parties‚Äîexposed the perpetrator to charges of acting in an unmanly or unwomanly way and, by extension, his or her nation to charges of dishonorable, uncivilized behavior. Purported atrocities and other perceived wrongdoings also created opportunities for soldiers to exact revenge with drastic countermeasures that could contradict taboos on destroying property and even those on killing women.</p>\n<p>Of course, such measures were never just about the attitudes of soldiers, but also the command climate, discipline, and policy goals. Furthermore, gendered contemporary reports and commentaries on the violence could be more about demonizing the enemy than about actual events or understanding what happened. The main examples explored in this section involve face-to-face encounters between German soldiers and French civilians in 1870‚Äì71 and the extreme use of violence by Thiers‚Äôs forces against the Commune in 1871.<sup id=\"fnref:10\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">10</a></sup></p>\n<p>All three sections [so was my plan] proceed from the fundamental premise that practices and experiences of manhood and womanhood are historically contingent, that men and women change over time, that normative masculinities and femininities change with them. The seemingly natural in their attitudes and behaviors is cultural and therefore a product of history. The second corollary premise is that war and warriors are creatures of their times, influenced by‚Äîand influencing‚Äîthem. Contrary to many narrowly conceived histories, not to mention widespread ahistorical elements of popular culture, there is no universal soldier or military leader.<sup id=\"fnref:11\"><a href=\"#fn:11\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">11</a></sup> Here, too, biology need not be destiny, whereas culture, if not properly analyzed in historical context, very well could be.<sup id=\"fnref:12\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">12</a></sup></p>\n<p>The third premise is that although the dual political and technological revolutions of the nineteenth century match up chronologically with the emergence of ‚Äútotal war‚Äù in the twentieth century, the journey never involved only a single plot line that led inexorably to 1914. Focusing on the role of gender‚Äîa fundamental component of human culture‚Äîcan help to make other formative strands of the story visible. It then becomes possible to complicate Stig F√∂rster‚Äôs powerful typology of warfare‚Äôs development in the modern era‚Äîcabinet war, people‚Äôs war, industrialized people‚Äôs war, and total war‚Äîwhose emphasis on parallel developments in war and politics can resemble a teleology, one subverted by events after 1945 and hard to reconcile with developments in warfare in other eras and cultures.<sup id=\"fnref:13\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">13</a></sup></p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>See Karen Hagemann, <em>M√§nnlicher Muth und teutsche Ehre: Nation, Milit√§r und Geschlecht in der Zeit der Antinapoleonischen Kriege Preussens</em> (Paderborn: Sch√∂ningh, 2001).&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>See esp.

				"content_text": "![Detail from ‚ÄúCombat at the military station: Of Chateau d‚Äô Eau, 24th February 1848 / combat au poste: Du Ch√¢teau d‚Äô Eau, 24 F√©vr. 1848](https://mrstoneman.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5144f7334b.jpg)\n\n<p class=\"callout\">I wrote this preliminary introduction for a thematic handbook article that was not to be (see <a href=\"https://markstoneman.com/2015/11/09/historiographical-impasse/\">\"Historiographical Impasse\"</a>). Looking back at this 2015 draft, I think it contains enough ideas to make it worth sharing.</p>\n\nIf military service had become a rite of passage for young men in much of Europe well before the mutual slaughter began in the summer of 1914, neither its ubiquity nor its meaning to those it embraced were foregone conclusions. To be sure, the fundamental challenge offered by the declaration of the lev√©e en masse in revolutionary France in 1793 represented an important first step, as did monarchical Prussia‚Äôs turn in 1813 to the near-general conscription of those men considered young and fit enough to join the fight. Indeed, Prussia‚Äôs response to the Napoleonic challenge intertwined military service, citizenship, and manhood in the gendered construction of a nation at war that bore a striking resemblance to those ideals manifest in the mobilizations of 1914.[^2] Nonetheless, near-universal manhood conscription took many more decades to predominate on the continent (never mind the United Kingdom, which did not resort to it until 1916).[^3]\n\nMoreover, the path was not at all direct, not from the state‚Äôs and army‚Äôs side nor from the general population‚Äôs. For the state and its military leadership, big citizens‚Äô armies could be desirable for fighting a foreign enemy, but they could also present a threat to the domestic-political status quo because they might not allow themselves to be used to suppress protest or insurrection at home. A further decisive factor was technology and how military leaders came to use it. Especially important were the railroads and the development of strategic thought and organizational structures that placed a premium on mobilizing large numbers of men at once for a decisive blow of the kind Helmuth von Moltke pulled off for Prussia at K√∂niggr√§tz (aka Sadowa) in 1866 and at Sedan in 1870 during the wars that produced a German nation-state.[^4]\n\nOf course, an approach to war of this kind also required large numbers of trained conscripts and experienced reservists. But first things first. The men targeted by conscription (and then the reserves) and the families and communities in which they had been raised first needed to learn to see the state‚Äôs call to the colors as legitimate and inescapable, let alone perceive value in the prospect.\n\nNineteenth-century discourses and attitudes regarding conscription were informed by normative assumptions about manhood in connection with a wide range of topics‚Äîcivic or national duty and martial sacrifice, forbearance and manliness, masculinity and bravery, willpower and human flesh versus modern weaponry (especially later in the century), the impact of length of service on soldiers‚Äô relationship to civilian society, civilian upbringings and soldiers‚Äô political reliability, the reputational impact of military service on veterans returning to civilian life, and so on. The gendered matrix of military service and citizenship was integral to warfare and its sociopolitical effects in Europe. This matrix is the subject of the first of three thematic sections comprising this [unrealized] chapter. Ordinary men in uniform occupy the center of this analysis, but other men and women who joined or supported the armed struggles‚Äîinterstate and intrastate‚Äîare also considered.\n\nThe importance and meaning of conscription in this period was also affected by the increasing cachet of nationality as an organizing principle for the European state system, or at least as a cultural manifestation that states could leverage.[^5] Whether in the ranks as conscripts, as substitutes for conscripts, as wartime volunteers, or by vocation, soldiers were beginning to be identified‚Äîand even identify themselves, at least in wartime‚Äîwith the nation-state or the national cause that they served. Many fought in conflicts that had national resonance among the general population, such as the Crimean War (1853‚Äì56), and many others fought in wars that led to the creation of the Italian and German nation-states (achieved in 1861 and 1871, respectively). The last case also entailed the national humiliation of France‚Äîwidely felt in that country‚Äîin a series of disastrous defeats (1870‚Äì71).\n\nThese conflicts did not just involve soldiers in the service of the state, however. The rise of nationality and ‚Äúthe people‚Äù as relevant factors saw men (and even women) join irregular formations to attain their national goals or, in the case of Italy, at least redeem their nation‚Äôs honor, whether that meant overturning a foreign or particularistic ruler (especially during the European revolutions of 1848) or defending their nation against a foreign invader or dying in the attempt. Or so the nationalist narratives went, even if some probably took up arms to defend their home and locality against the privations of requisitioning and marauding.\n\nThese decades also saw men and women (and youth) in cities resort to violence in order to change constitutional structures or protest economic and social conditions.[^6a] Whether or not any military experience was involved in the barricade building of 1848, memories of earlier revolts had certainly been passed down to the frequently subaltern generations of that time, a legacy that was also evident during the Paris Commune‚Äôs struggle in 1871.[^6b] Intertwined with implicit and explicit discourses about citizenship and belonging‚Äîand thus about manhood and womanhood, too‚Äîthese episodes also belonged to the complex, often violent process of nation formation and consolidation. At the same time, in this context of nation-making wars and insurrections, the seemingly contradictory phenomenon of international volunteers serving a national cause must also be considered.[^7]\n\nThe circles of social actors and norms to potentially include in a gendered analysis of the above mentioned wars and insurrections could be expanded a great deal further, if space constraints and available research permitted it. Whenever gender played a role in constructing or understanding the motivation and practices of those fighting, that role conceptually comprised both masculinity and femininity because gender, like class and race, is a relational concept. If the military world had become almost exclusively male and masculine in the nineteenth century, that manhood still presupposed relationships with women and femininity.\n\nNormative femininity might be embodied in the appearance and comportment of women accompanying the army (in France, holdovers like the cantin√®re) or nursing the wounded (in the Crimea, Mary Seacole and Florence Nightingale). There were also the women at home for whom one fought, or the girl one intended to marry after completing active duty. Normative images of women in the minds of soldiers could affect those soldiers‚Äô reactions to encounters with women in wartime, in the course of requisitioning food from civilians or sleeping in civilians‚Äô homes or outbuildings‚Äîor when fighting irregulars or taking a town street by street. Finally, a siege army could not make distinctions between soldiers and civilians, men and woman, adults and children in a besieged city (as in the Prussian-German siege of Paris in 1870‚Äì71). On the other hand, policy decisions reached in the besieged city itself (or policy lacunae) could create great differences‚Äîbetween rich and poor, soldiers and civilians (and therefore also between men and women), and so on.\n\nNo matter how powerful memories of the lev√©e en masse continued to be in the middle decades of nineteenth century France, to take the most famous example of a nation in arms, patriotism and √©lan were not enough to win wars. One also needed professional expertise to train and lead men in war or in the suppression of an insurrection. With different educational levels and frequently a more elevated social background, officers might well embody masculinity differently than the men in their charge, especially if they were noblemen. Furthermore, as military technologies grew and military organizations became more complex, the knowledge required by at least some of the officers expanded. As the job changed, so too could the men doing it.\n\nThese developments were accompanied by public and internal debates about military leadership. What qualities did officers require? From which stock was recruitment most desirable? What training did they require? What was their relationship to their men supposed to look like? How did they treat their subordinates? And what about their relationship to acknowledged social equals and supposed inferiors‚Äîespecially men‚Äîoutside the military? How did their expertise and comportment figure into their practice of masculinity and its reception? What did military service and sacrifice mean to these men? How did social background and family history shape that meaning? Finally, what about their private lives? How did marriage and family fit into their military careers? To what extent did the bourgeois ideal of a separate domestic sphere obtain in this context? Of course, each of these questions could lead to more than one answer because officer corps were by no means homogeneous.[^8] Furthermore, some important military leaders did not fit within this framework at all, most prominently Giuseppe Garibaldi, whose biography, relationship to his fighters, and influential public image form an instructive counterpoint.[^9]\n\nMoreover, if soldiers were citizens acting on behalf of the nation, their actions might be expected to bear a closer relationship to the values and norms that guided their behavior in civilian life. Actual or alleged practices in wartime that appeared contrary to the predominant normative conception of war‚Äîstill largely informed by the metaphor of a dual between two equal and honorable parties‚Äîexposed the perpetrator to charges of acting in an unmanly or unwomanly way and, by extension, his or her nation to charges of dishonorable, uncivilized behavior. Purported atrocities and other perceived wrongdoings also created opportunities for soldiers to exact revenge with drastic countermeasures that could contradict taboos on destroying property and even those on killing women.\n\nOf course, such measures were never just about the attitudes of soldiers, but also the command climate, discipline, and policy goals. Furthermore, gendered contemporary reports and commentaries on the violence could be more about demonizing the enemy than about actual events or understanding what happened. The main examples explored in this section involve face-to-face encounters between German soldiers and French civilians in 1870‚Äì71 and the extreme use of violence by Thiers‚Äôs forces against the Commune in 1871.[^10]\n\nAll three sections [so was my plan] proceed from the fundamental premise that practices and experiences of manhood and womanhood are historically contingent, that men and women change over time, that normative masculinities and femininities change with them. The seemingly natural in their attitudes and behaviors is cultural and therefore a product of history. The second corollary premise is that war and warriors are creatures of their times, influenced by‚Äîand influencing‚Äîthem. Contrary to many narrowly conceived histories, not to mention widespread ahistorical elements of popular culture, there is no universal soldier or military leader.[^11] Here, too, biology need not be destiny, whereas culture, if not properly analyzed in historical context, very well could be.[^12]\n\nThe third premise is that although the dual political and technological revolutions of the nineteenth century match up chronologically with the emergence of ‚Äútotal war‚Äù in the twentieth century, the journey never involved only a single plot line that led inexorably to 1914. Focusing on the role of gender‚Äîa fundamental component of human culture‚Äîcan help to make other formative strands of the story visible. It then becomes possible to complicate Stig F√∂rster‚Äôs powerful typology of warfare‚Äôs development in the modern era‚Äîcabinet war, people‚Äôs war, industrialized people‚Äôs war, and total war‚Äîwhose emphasis on parallel developments in war and politics can resemble a teleology, one subverted by events after 1945 and hard to reconcile with developments in warfare in other eras and cultures.[^13]\n\n\n[^2]: See Karen Hagemann, _M√§nnlicher Muth und teutsche Ehre: Nation, Milit√§r und Geschlecht in der Zeit der Antinapoleonischen Kriege Preussens_ (Paderborn: Sch√∂ningh, 2001). \n\n[^3]: See esp.

Thinking about using it again and revisiting some old stomping grounds in the blogosphere, I found <a href=\"http://www.dancohen.org/2013/12/22/information-overload-past-and-present/\">Dan Cohen's relevant comments</a> on Ann Blair's <em>Too Much to Know.</em> Seems I am in good company with my occasional ignoring of information‚Äîignoring that I prefer to think won't lead to, might even prevent, ignorance.</p>\n\n<p>I treat Twitter rather cavalierly too, as if it were a place to hang out, learn stuff, share things, and then leave‚Äîsometimes for longer spells. If I view all these information inputs in social terms, this is a perfectly rational way to engage with the Twittersphere. If I worried about missing some bit of news, some fascinating article or weird event, I would never get anything done and my mind would become a still murkier mess. Besides, meaningful ideas and conversations tend to have longer lifespans, and they make themselves felt in other contexts.</p>\n\n<p>Dan's piece, indeed his whole blog, reminds me of another thing. Much ostensibly older writing on the web has value, and sometimes we should take a moment to read bits of it instead of gulping down and spewing forth a remixed version of the latest clever insight or rant.

				"content_text": "<p>The polarizing contemporary debate on science in the United States could be extraordinarily interesting for historians of <a href=\"https://historyofknowledge.net/about/\">knowledge</a>, if it were occurring in the past. Still, if we could divert our attention from the news for a moment, we might find it offers some food for thought.</p>\n\n<p>In the midst of the current conversation, which is experiencing renewed fervor under the new administration, the Twitterverse is exploding with talk of \"truthiness,\" \"alternative facts,\" \"fact-based journalism,\" \"fake news,\" and \"lies.\" This rhetoric encompasses not just climate science but also everyday policy-making and \"s/he said\" ‚Äì \"s/he said\" arguments. It is easy to get caught up in this conversation, whose ideological and epistemological battle lines seem so clearly drawn, but one thing gets lost‚Äîmost of the time, anyway.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>A pair of tweets¬†offered a funny and useful reminder recently. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AliceDreger/status/829382360206626830\">Alice Dreger remarked</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the science march happens, I plan to be with my fellow historians and sociologists of science in the \"yes, but\" crowd.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bhgross144/status/829383779441577985\">Ben Gross replied</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WHAT DO WE WANT?<br />* ACCEPTANCE THAT SCIENCE IS A COMPLEX SOCIAL PROCESS!<br/>WHEN DO WE WANT IT?<br />* AFTER A WELL-RESEARCHED HISTORICAL DISCUSSION!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the concerns of historians studying science in particular and knowledge more generally do not lend themselves to sloganeering, they nonetheless have something constructive to offer. For starters, the above tweets remind us that scientists are social beings in specific institutional and disciplinary contexts. The embeddedness of science goes further, however, for science coexists with other modes of knowing.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, if the scientific consensus about climate change is broadly correct, that does not mean we get to dismiss climate change deniers merely with rhetoric about \"facts,\" which themselves have a history. Instead, what if we were to take seriously the knowledge not only of the climate scientists and their allies but also of their opponents?</p>\n\n<p>This question does not represent a naive argument about everything being relative. The point, instead, is to recall that the producers and adherents of science and other forms of academic knowledge coexist in sociocultural matrices with other forms of knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Leaving aside religion, metaphysics, or issues raised by quantum physics and the nature of consciousness, most people‚Äîscientists and laypeople alike‚Äîtake the existence of objective reality as a given, at least in their everyday lives. They are also willing to accept many scientific findings that they cannot verify with their own senses. For many of these same people, however, climate science is a bridge too far. Why?</p>\n\n<p>It is easy to blame the U.S. education system or the scientific community for not communicating the scientific method adequately. It is also easy to portray science and religion as mutually incompatible. Such approaches do not take seriously the agency of climate change deniers (or immunization rejectors, GMO opponents, etc.) and so cannot engage their opponents in a meaningful fashion. Disagreement takes on an ideological air. There is only right and wrong, good-faith actors and bad‚Äîor the terribly ignorant.</p>\n<p>Such struggles are almost inevitable and probably necessary. Nonetheless, wouldn't it be useful to explore the operations and logics of the alternative, non- or antiscientific knowledge that informs climate change deniers and skeptics of other scientifically supported practices? Put differently, the privileged position of scientific and other modes of academic knowing should not be allowed to blind us to other forms of knowing practiced by other social actors.</p>\n\n<p>From this point of view, it seems to me, a knowledge perspective has much to offer, even if historians will have to leave current societal challenges surrounding knowledge to the sociologists and anthropologists.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://mrstoneman.micro.blog/uploads/2024/66dd0ce4ea.jpg\" alt=\"Two protesters in Washington, DC, near the Washington Monument, one with a sign that reads, 'What do we want?

It has received a big boost recently from the GHI's new focus on the <a href=\"/2016/07/08/a-few-notes-on-the-history-of-knowledge/\">history of knowledge</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A truism holds that generals prepare to fight the last war, not the next one. Unable to peer into the future, they make do with the lessons of the past. Fair enough, perhaps, but this common-sense wisdom presupposes that military leaders will necessarily understand the salient features of the last war without preconceptions about war and officering affecting their discernment. In other words, the truism fails to account for the effects of prior training, experience, and acculturation in the production of knowledge about war. Instead, it implicitly assumes the existence of universal soldierdom, as if officering and soldiering‚Äîbut for technology‚Äîwere not culturally and historically contingent.</p>\n\n<p>Wilhelm Groener (1867‚Äì1939) offers a case in point. A general staff officer in the German army who rose to prominence quickly in the First World War, Groener became an important spokesman in the interwar period for the so-called Schlieffen school, offering an interpretation of the war seemingly at odds with what actually happened. Instead of deriving new lessons from the stalemate, as his contemporary Erich Ludendorff did in a <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/Ludendorff-Erich-Der-totale-Krieg\">nightmarish vision of politics serving war instead of vice versa</a>, Groener doubled down on the knowledge he had internalized in peacetime Wilhelmine Germany. Issuing from neither a military outsider nor an original thinker and steeped in antebellum military thoughtways and culture, Groener‚Äôs interpretation of the First World War can be analyzed in relation to his prewar training and wartime experiences to show the inner logic of the professional military knowledge and culture in which¬†he was steeped.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>My initial personal takeaway from tonight‚Äôs lecture on <a href=\"https://www.ghi-dc.org/events/event/date/toward-a-spatial-narrative-of-the-1935-harlem-riot-mapping-and-storytelling-after-the-geospatial-turn-20-10-2016\">digital mapping</a>: It looks useful as an analytical tool, and for presentation, but in the end we still have to write narratives. Historians have to make choices, not present facts that merely speak for themselves.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>During the question and answer period, the story-telling aspect of such enterprises became clearer. Apparently a kind of directed narrative is the idea. Unfortunately, that got lost in the presentation of tools aimed at the already initiated. An inordinate amount of space was given to talking about digital mapping per se and not enough about the history that he was mapping.</p>\n<p>I would have liked to hear more about the insights that a given mapping project offers. If digital mapping were a product for sale, I would be the consumer who needs to be convinced why that category of product is desirable in the first place. The issues involved in getting value out of a specific iteration of that product are secondary.</p>\n<p>I think many members of the profession are at this stage, which is one reason why gaining professional recognition (tenure) for output other than the monograph is an ongoing struggle. We need to gain a better understanding of the value of these projects.</p>\n<p>But this public event was a keynote lecture for a <a href=\"https://www.ghi-dc.org/events/event/date/creating-spatial-historical-knowledge-new-approaches-opportunities-and-epistemological-implications-of-mapping-history-digitally-20-10-2016\">conference</a>. Part of the audience included people who, like me, are interested in but not initiated in the assumptions and concerns of digital mapping projects. The other part of the audience, however, comprised conference participants deeply immersed in the tools discussed and the reasons behind their creation and use. Trying to bridge that gap is never an easy task for a speaker.</p>\n<p>In any case, I look forward to the conference presentations tomorrow, optimistic that they will help me learn more about the historiographical motivations behind this kind of work. I just hope the history, not the tools used to do it, predominates in the discussions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n",

My topic was on the matrix of gender, war, and nation in European wars in the 1850s through the 1870s. Given the limited historiography, I chose a thematic approach, but that produces the undesired overlap. What is needed instead, I&rsquo;m told, is a gendered history of these specific wars.

				"content_text": "I have had to withdraw from an interesting handbook project because of excessive overlap with two other chapters. My topic was on the matrix of gender, war, and nation in European wars in the 1850s through the 1870s.

Source: <a href=\"http://www.landesarchiv-bw.de/plink?f=1-116160-1\">Landesarchiv Baden-W√ºrttemberg</a>.</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I recently noticed that the English translation of <em>Der Schlieffenplan: Analysen und Dokumente</em>, edited by Hans Ehlert, Michael Epkenhans, and Gerhard P. Gro√ü, is now available from the University Press of Kentucky under the title <em><a href=\"http://www.kentuckypress.com/live/title_detail.php?titleid=3614#.VIEqeBN6r8u\">The Schlieffen Plan: International Perspectives on the German Strategy for World War I</a></em>. Interestingly, Terence Zuber, who sparked much of the debate on German war planning prior to the Great War, declined to allow his chapter from the German original to be included in this English translation.<sup id=\"fnref-2178-9\"><a href=\"#fn-2178-9\">1</a></sup> It wasn't his best piece anyway, far more peevish than usual, and there is plenty of his work on the supposedly nonexistent Schlieffen Plan already available in English. Be that as it may, if Zuber's thesis about Schlieffen's war planning has been conclusively disproven, the assumptions underlying his work have received less attention.<sup id=\"fnref-2178-8\"><a href=\"#fn-2178-8\">2</a></sup> That matters because his work on Schlieffen continues to be widely read and discussed, having made a big splash when it first came out. Moreover, he continues to write and publish books on German military history.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Zuber makes his historiographical assumptions explicit on the¬†\"About\" page of his website (<a href=\"http://terencezuber.com\">terencezuber.com</a>) in a section called \"Philosophy of writing military history.\" The text seems to be for the benefit of potential new customers, but that does not make it any less sincere or interesting. The first important factor he lists is \"the careful analysis of primary source material,\" which he learned during his graduate studies in W√ºrzburg, Germany. Zuber is talking about the venerable historiographical tradition of source criticism as taught to us in the nineteenth century by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_von_Ranke\">Leopold von Ranke</a>. The historian, according to Ranke, is supposed to use primary sources in order to write about \"how things really were\" (<em>wie es eigentlich gewesen ist</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Ranke's ideas presuppose that the historian can read and understand the sources in context and that their meaning is immutable. If the objectivity question is much more complicated than Ranke's phrase suggests, trying to understand \"how things really were\" still informs the professional historian's ethos.<sup id=\"fnref-2178-1\"><a href=\"#fn-2178-1\">3</a></sup> But how do we meet this standard on the basis of imperfect documentary testimony? How do we go about reading and interpreting sources whose meanings are frequently ambiguous?</p>\n\n<p>\"In military history,\" according to Zuber, getting at the past as it actually was \"means above all the evaluation of training, doctrine, plans, intelligence estimates, orders, weather, terrain and tactical combat.\" I can live with that assertion for the moment, even if it <a title=\"'Terence Zuber's Image of War and the Schlieffen Plan Debate' [Stoneman's Corner]\" href=\"http://markstoneman.com/2012/02/11/terence-zubers-image-of-war-and-the-schlieffen-plan-debate/\">ignores important factors</a>, especially politics. But how can Zuber be so sure that he understands the sources whereas his historical predecessors and present-day detractors do not?</p>\n\n<p>His answer is simple: \"As a professional infantry officer, I am able to apply twenty years of military experience to this analysis including three years with a German panzer division. I work through military history as though it were an actual war plan or military operation.\" On the face of it, the assumption that his military background is historiographically relevant seems at least plausible insofar as the tools and techniques of warfare in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were not so far removed from Zuber's Cold War‚Äìera training in land warfare that they could not be understood from that point of view.<sup id=\"fnref-2178-10\"><a href=\"#fn-2178-10\">4</a></sup> Moreover, German operational thought‚Äîhowever vaguely defined and varyingly understood‚Äîenjoyed respect on both sides of the Atlantic long after the First World War.<sup id=\"fnref-2178-3\"><a href=\"#fn-2178-3\">5</a></sup> But is that enough? Does Zuber's military background really guarantee the accuracy of his analysis of military documents from an earlier era?</p>\n\n<p>In his own words, Zuber \"work[s] through military history as though it were an actual war plan or military operation.\" The key element here is Zuber himself. He is playing out World War One‚Äìera military scenarios on the basis of his own military-professional judgement, which he developed in the 1970s and 1980s. This statement certainly comports with an unfortunately common assumption in military history and in writing about war more generally, namely that soldiering is a timeless phenomenon, aside from the obvious changes in technology, organization, and (if the historian is really doing his or her job) politico-economic basis. But as John Lynn shows in his book <em>Battle</em>, there is no such thing as the \"universal soldier.\" Soldiers and their institutions exist in specific historical contexts, and they change over time. These changes run deep, encompassing not only the externalities of the soldiers' and militaries' worlds, but also how soldiers and armies perceive the world around them.</p>\n\n<p>Even if the <a href=\"http://markstoneman.com/2014/11/21/not-a-military-historian/\">military historian</a> is concerned exclusively with the age-old question of how well armies fought, Lynn's argument applies: \"the way militaries think is the most fundamental element of their effectiveness.\"<sup id=\"fnref-2178-5\"><a href=\"#fn-2178-5\">6</a></sup> We cannot understand what officers in the past were seeing and understanding, unless we first grasp how they thought. Indeed, Lynn demonstrates \"the influence of conceptual culture on the reality of combat\" for a variety of cultures and eras.<sup id=\"fnref-2178-6\"><a href=\"#fn-2178-6\">7</a></sup> The upshot of culture in general terms is that two hypothetical armies might be similarly equipped, but that in no way means they will understand the same set of circumstances similarly. The choices that the commanders of these armies perceive are shaped by culture, whether that is military culture in the broadest sense, specific aspects of military culture such as strategic culture and leadership culture, institution-specific cultures, or broader cultural \"givens\" that trancend the boundaries of the military.</p>\n\n<p>Without accounting for culture, Zuber's efforts to \"work through military history as though it were an actual war plan or military operation\" run the risk of amounting to little more than a war game set in the past, but based on modern-day assumptions. That is how Schlieffen studied the ancient Battle of Cannae, but it is no way for the historian to work who aspires to understand \"how things really were.\" Yes, there is a need for good, detail-oriented histories on war planning and military operations, but those histories must take into account the different historical contexts, including the professional culture in which operational decisions were made.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>See p. 14 of this translation, which was visible to me on the preview offered by Google Books.¬†<a href=\"#fnref-2178-9\">‚Ü©</a></li>\n<li>Besides offering well-reasoned arguments based on solid evidence, the book reprints sources not considered by Zuber.

				"content_text": "<p>At the end of his English-language review of Anne Sudrow‚Äôs long book (in German) about the shoe in National Socialism, Neil Gregor has some choice remarks about German academic publishing, particularly dissertations and the second advanced dissertation (<em>Habilitation</em>) that would-be professors in Germany have to write.<sup id=\"fnref-2129-1\"><a class=\"jetpack-footnote\" href=\"#fn-2129-1\">1</a></sup> Of course, he does not mean all or even most scholarly books in Germany, but as an editor and historian, I do have to deal with the tendency he describes rather a lot. I'm sure translators will feel Gregor's pain too.\n\n <!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Inevitably, there are sections in an 800-page book where the reader‚Äôs spirits flag, and where one wonders whether some editing down might not have improved the readability of the book at little cost to the comprehensiveness of its argument. No self-respecting German Ph.D. monograph would spare its reader a fifty-page discussion of the state of research, <em>Fragestellung</em>, and methodology; a suitably earnest discussion of the definition of a shoe is also, of course, a must. Yet life is short, and the half-hour I devoted to mastering the different kinds of shoe polish available to consumers in the 1920s is a half-hour of my life that I will not get back.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, scholarly monographs, like shoes, have their own product history‚Äîthey can no more be seen as isolated objects, standing outside of time and space, than the things with laces that we wear on our feet. In that sense, any such critical remarks are as much a comment on the academic <em>habitus</em> that consistently produces such books as it is on the book itself. The culture of subsidy which permeates German scholarly publishing, combined with a scholarly environment which places such emphasis on thoroughness, can all too easily permit indulgence. Rather like the German manufacturers this book describes‚Äîambivalent about their customers, and irritated by their habits‚Äîone often feels that German academic authors ought to take their readers a bit less for granted.

				"content_text": "<p>I study European history, so why did I post about <a href=\"/2014/11/29/sand-creek/\">Sand Creek</a> earlier today? And why excerpt seemingly gratuitous violence? I have no expertise in U.S. history, but I am interested in the history of violence per se, which can reveal a lot about peoples and cultures at a given point in history. Further, the U.S. Civil War has some important structural similarities to the Franco-Prussian War, and perhaps to other European wars in the mid nineteenth century.<sup id=\"fnref-2081-1\"><a href=\"#fn-2081-1\">1</a></sup> Given the causal relationship between the U.S. Civil War and the expansion of violence against Native Americans out west, there might be a case, for example, to include France‚Äôs nineteenth-century colonial conflicts in such a comparison. However, my main interest relates to cultural taboos---or lack thereof---about specific kinds of violence against specific categories of people, assuming those people have not been perceived to violate any important taboos themselves.</p>\n<p>In this particular case, the willingness to kill women and children indiscriminately underlines how little value these people‚Äôs lives had in the eyes of their butchers. Further, it suggests how utterly alien these Indians were in the eyes of their attackers, how far outside the attackers‚Äô own ethnos or kin-culture community.<sup id=\"fnref-2081-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2081-2\">2</a></sup> Indeed, in Michael Fellman's account of the guerrilla conflict in Missouri during the Civil War, white fighting men broke more cultural taboos in their fight against Indians than they did when committing violence against free and enslaved black people.<sup id=\"fnref-2081-3\"><a href=\"#fn-2081-3\">3</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>At the same time, <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/resources/archives/four/sandcrk.htm\">Congressional testimony</a> points to other attitudes towards the slaughtered Native Americans. We hear of white men with native partners and sons, for instance, although the latter were called ‚Äúhalf breed.‚Äù The paternalistic congressmen investigating the atrocity were also humane, in a certain sense, but a question about how long the witness-cum-translator had lived with the Indians suggests how different that congressman perceived him to be. At the same time, commentators who sided with the Colorado troops responsible for the massacre portrayed their opponents as brave. Of course, it was safer to make the women and children seem like incidental casualties of a battle, but the self-respect of fighting men also requires a worthy opponent. Without one, the act of killing brings no honor and---we are learning in recent conflicts---can leave deep scars in the soldier who pulls the trigger.<sup id=\"fnref-2081-4\"><a href=\"#fn-2081-4\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>Given the tiny source base behind this post, it only represents an approach to such violence, nothing more, especially since such an approach must also consider the specific historical context of this awful American story.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-2081-1\">See Stig F√∂rster and J√∂rg Nagler, eds., <em>On the Road to Total War: The American Civil War and the German Wars of Unification, 1861‚Äì1871</em> (Washington, DC: Cambridge Universtiy Press, 1997).¬†<a href=\"#fnref-2081-1\">‚Ü©</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn-2081-2\">On kin-culture communities, see Azar Gat with Alexsander Yakobson, <em>Nations: The Long and Deep Roots of Political Ethnicity and Nationalism</em> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2013).¬†<a href=\"#fnref-2081-2\">‚Ü©</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn-2081-3\">Michael Fellman, <em>Inside War: The Guerilla Conflict in Missouri during the American Civil War</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989).¬†<a href=\"#fnref-2081-3\">‚Ü©</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn-2081-4\">See <a href=\"http://www.afhso.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101201-051.pdf\">Sharon E.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->",
				"content_text": "<p>While talking in class tonight about forthcoming papers, I heard from several students that many of their professors haven't cared which system they used, as long as it was clear and they could retrace the student's steps if necessary. That's also long been my implicit attitude, even though I ask students to follow Chicago or Turabian and I correct their papers accordingly. Lately, however, I have come to think that teaching a specific style is actually important, even if I have done little more than point students in the right directions for style guidelines, much as I was told to use a given style manual back in the day.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>But why does it matter if they use Chicago or whatever else? The historian in me says that they should learn the trade as I learned it. On the other hand, I am dealing with MA students, few of whom plan to go the PhD route, so I should not necessarily treat such classes as mini-apprenticeships for future historians. If most are studying for other reasons, why does enforcing a specific style matter?</p>\n<p>First, all educated people need to know how to use the scholarly apparatus (footnotes or endnotes, bibliography) of any text they read, because information crucial to the author's argument is there: evidence, intellectual debts to other scholars, and so on. I learned some of this by reading a great deal of history, but writing it helped me even more. And to do this work, I needed to follow a specific system that my professors understood, just like I had to write in English and follow a bunch of rules and customs associated with that. With that experience in mind, it seems to me that students can grow intellectually by acquiring more practice in such citation habits, even if they are not in my class as apprentice historians.</p>\n<p>Second, my work as an editor has shown how far too many professionals ignore style sheets when they submit their written work for publication. For me, that merely creates a hassle and consumes time, but I can imagine much worse consequences in other writing contexts. Submit a job or grant application without following the directions? Forget it. Get an article through peer review that ignores the basic conventions of the discipline? Never. And so many other writing tasks‚Äîwhether internal to a profession or organization or for the wider public‚Äîrequire one to follow specific guidelines and conventions. Indeed, it seems to me that we educated professionals should be able to learn and adapt to the specific style and formatting requirements of whatever writing task comes our way, even if that requires decoding seemingly arcane directions.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I went to the annual meeting of the <a href=\"http://www.smh-hq.org/\">Society of Military History</a> this year, because it was in the DC area, if way out in Crystal City. It was good to see and talk with people, especially a particular <a href=\"https://www.coloradocollege.edu/academics/dept/history/people/profile.html?person=showalter_dennis_edwin\">outside reader</a> of my dissertation, who I was glad to run into. The book display was also interesting, because I discovered titles that the same publishers had not shown at the <a href=\"http://historians.org/\">AHA</a> meeting in January.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p>Less interesting were the panels, which are actually the main event of conferences. The problem was not the quality of scholarship but rather the fact that I have a low tolerance for being read to. I try to be patient and grown-up and stuff, but my mind starts to wander in this format. I wish that presenters would let go of the notion that they need to fill their 15 or 20 minutes with as much text as possible and instead just focus on pitching their main points and the central evidence that they are using to make them.</p>\n<p>When I complained about this on Twitter and Facebook, I heard other scholars feeling the same way. We should not be reading our papers, but most of us do. One colleague on Facebook also shared a link to an interesting paper on <a class=\"no-file-icon\" href=\"http://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/howtotalk.pdf\">\"How to Give an Academic Talk\"</a> (by Paul N. Edwards). The trick, I think, is to adopt as much of the advice in this paper as one can without feeling so intimidated that one resorts to the crutch of reading to an audience. The result won't be perfect, but it will be far better for listeners than the standard alternative.</p>\n<p>As boring as the reading format is, though, the panels in this conference were particularly well filled‚Äîstanding room only in the couple I visited (one with senior historians and one with graduate students, both with papers read to the audience), which I have not seen at any AHA or <a href=\"http://www.thebhc.org/\">BHC</a> conferences (where papers, unfortunately, are also read).</p>\n<p>A few other impressions: the conference seemed to include both people who call themselves military historians and those who just happen to be doing a related topic. It also included members of the military itself, as well as professors who teach the military at the War College and related institutions. The mix reinforced my opinion that military history and business history share <a href=\"http://markstoneman.com/2012/01/31/military-history-and-business-history/\">analogous positions</a> within the field of academic history and relative to the occupational fields that they study.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, whereas we had the teachers of our future generals at the conference in Crystal City and the teachers of future CEOs at the conference in Philly, I saw practitioners (officers) in Crystal City but no practitioners (business leaders) in Philly. This might have been due to the proximity of the conference to the Pentagon and other military installations in the area, but I wonder if this one difference says anything about different attitudes towards history in the military and business. Few doubt the importance of history for cultivating critical thinking in our military officers, especially not the officers themselves, but I wonder how passionate about history business executives are. It would be interesting to find out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n",

				"content_text": "<p><a id=\"cite01\"></a>Last week I read J√∂rg Muth, <em>Command Culture</em>.<a href=\"#note01\"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong></a> The book‚Äôs main subject is about training U.S. officers for war, and it draws on the German officer corps in the interwar period for its useful comparisons. I can‚Äôt offer a review, because my own expertise lies more with the Imperial German officer corps. Nonetheless, the book deserves some comment.</p>\n\n<p>This was both an enjoyable and a frustrating read, but the frustrating part had more to do with my own preferences. Muth (who I know and value) takes West Point in this period to task for some pretty lousy education (Fort Leavenworth, too) and awful hazing. I have no problem with such well-sourced assertions, but I can‚Äôt help but think there might have been a deeper cultural logic to these things that Muth does not seek to uncover, because it apparently did not relate to military effectiveness, which is his topic, not, for example, the deeper character of leadership, education, and masculinity in the United States more generally.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>I don‚Äôt have the expertise to critique Muth‚Äôs interpretation of officer education in this period, and I‚Äôm convinced he knows what he is talking about. But my guard goes up when I read works that are not only critical, but also assume an air of being smarter than their human subjects. It seems to me that we historians need to be more modest than that. Still, this is a question of personal style, and Muth is by no means alone in following such an approach, especially in military history, which straddles a line between historiographical traditions, sometimes trying to understand the past on its own terms (as I was trained to do in a program and profession in which, unfortunately, ‚Äúmilitary history‚Äù can even be a dirty word), but also trying to judge what worked and didn‚Äôt work, a worthy question that interests Muth and many other military historians, to say nothing of policy makers, military professionals, and the lay public.<a href=\"#note02\"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></a></p>\n<p>Let me provide an example from the Imperial German period. In his conclusion Muth writes,</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The German Great General Staff saw a steady steep decline in performance after its founder and mentor, Moltke the Elder, retired. His successors tried in vain to emulate the habits and outward appearance of the great old man but failed miserably in their basic tasks‚Äîto provide leadership, strategic planning skills and sound advice for the head of state‚Äîuntil the whole organization collapsed in the apocalyptic defeat of a two-front war, which every sane staff officer would have thought to prevent with all its might (181-82).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I interpret the General Staff‚Äôs professionalism and competence differently,<a href=\"#note03\"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></a> but Muth‚Äôs take is certainly consistent with a great deal of historiography. Indeed, his comment points to the need for me to participate in this debate with more scholarship of my own. The part that bothers me, though, is the last dependent clause in the above quote. Yes, the project that Germany‚Äôs leadership embarked on in 1914 seems insane from our own vantage point. It even seems insane based on our interpretation of what was known back then. But denying the rationality of German war planning and the professionalism of its planners amounts to a refusal to take them seriously and enter their thought world in order to truly understand what it was they thought they were doing in 1914.</p>\n<p>But this is not the focus of the book. Instead, the Imperial period offers but a foil against which Muth measures German military professionalism in the interwar period, and he uses the latter as a foil for criticizing U.S. military education at the time. Furthermore, Muth is not so much interested in war planning, grand strategy, and so on, as he is in how officers led‚Äîor didn‚Äôt lead‚Äîon the battlefield. This is a crucial question, and his observations on the differences between American and German approaches to military leadership at the beginning of World War II offer plenty of food for thought, which I hope specialists of this period will soon discuss.</p>\n<p>One last note: Muth provides the place of education and year of graduation with the first mention of each U.S. officer he names, for example, ‚ÄúGeneral George Smith Patton, USMA 1909‚Äù (29). He offers this highly suggestive information to provide readers with a sense of the personal networks that officers developed in their formative years. This makes me wish for further, even prosopographical studies of the U.S. officer corps that employ such data, just as we need more of it in the German case, if with other reference points, such as the first regiment of a German officer, although I have also noticed some tantalizing overlap in the years that Wilhelm Groener and other officers attended the War Academy in Wilhelmine Germany.<a id=\"note01\"></a></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\"/>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong><a id=\"note02\"></a><a id=\"note03\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#cite01\"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong></a> J√∂rg Muth, <em>Command Culture: Officer Education in the U.S. Army and the German Armed Forces, 1901‚Äì1940, and the Consequences for World War II</em> (Denton, TX: University of North Texas Press, 2011).</p>\n<p><a href=\"#cite02\"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></a>For a useful discussion of the tensions inherent in writing military history because of the multiple constituencies it serves, see Stephen Morillo with Michael Pavokovic, <em>What is Military History?</em> (Malden, MA: Polity Press, 2006).</p>\n<p><a href=\"#cite03\"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></a>Mark R.

I don‚Äôt mean this is in a negative way. I haven‚Äôt tired of this topic. But I‚Äôm not always sure why it should matter to other people. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p>If I look at the <a href=\"http://markstoneman.com/2012/02/11/terence-zubers-image-of-war-and-the-schlieffen-plan-debate/\">Schlieffen Plan debate</a> carried out mainly in the pages of <em>War in History</em>, it is clear that Groener‚Äôs perspective has something to offer that audience, because the man who initiated the debate, Zuber, accuses him of having \"invented\" the Schlieffen Plan. That is reason enough to bring up the issue, at least for those interested in the military planning that helped cause and shape what George F. Kennan once called <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/616.html\">‚Äúthe great seminal catastrophe‚Äù</a> of the twentieth century.</p>\n<p>When I shift my perspective to understanding the German military‚Äôs role in the outbreak of World War One, I find the more nuanced perspective of German military thinking worthwhile for its own sake, but the basic story line of an inflexible plan that offered no diplomatic wiggle room and helped to ensure that Germany played the role of aggressor remains the same. So why should anyone but a specialist in military history care? Why should it matter to a general historian of modern German or European history?</p>\n<p>The answer to this question seems to relate to our image of German history and World War I more generally. Do we blame that war on elites wedded to outdated notions about war? Do we turn them into alien ‚ÄúOthers‚Äù who are impossible to understand in anything but stereotyped terms along the lines that we see for Britain in the wonderful comedy series, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/blackadder/episodes/four/\"><em>Black Adder Goes Forth</em></a>?</p>\n<p>Or do we open our eyes to a less comfortable thought? What if World War I was not an aberration, but rather part and parcel of European (and Western) modernity? And what if the officers who developed and later justified Germany‚Äôs war plans were not defenders of a premodern monarchical system nor simply protecting their own reputations after Germany‚Äôs defeat, but instead were modern military professionals whose attitudes and efforts might have relevance for our understanding of modern militaries far beyond 1914?</p>\n<p>The latter point of view could make the question of Groener‚Äôs Schlieffen Plan relevant for modern militaries and, therefore, interesting for a readership like the <em>Journal of Strategic Studies</em> has. But does this story only have something to tell scholars of military history and strategic studies? What about historians of Imperial Germany? I think an answer could relate to the modernity of the officer corps, the Great General Staff, and the war itself. It might also help us to understand a story whose chronological boundaries transcend political regimes, insofar as this one reaches from Wilhelmine Germany until close to the end of the Weimar Republic, if not further.</p>\n<p>As I think along these lines, however, I see a journal article grow into something too big for the format. I would like to keep thinking about why Groener's Schlieffen Plan might matter to general historians of Germany, but maybe I first need to concentrate on a narrower, more specialized audience. I have to write a lot more before I can know.</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n",

Thus, I feel the section I wrote still has value for anyone trying to understand this debate. I mention that here and make the dissertation <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/WilhelmGroenerOfficeringAndTheSchlieffenPlan\">freely available</a> because some of the most important scholarship is locked behind the pay walls of professional history journals. That is fine for those of us with access to well-stocked university libraries, but not everyone is so fortunate. Zuber himself has been canny about this limitation of modern scholarship, which so often engages other scholars but does not reach out to the general public. He has rehearsed his arguments in an affordable book for the mass market called <em>The Real German War Plan</em> (The History Press, 2011). While this will not earn him points in academia, it serves the useful function of engaging the public, which more of us should do.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n<p>Zuber's ideas are important because he insists on taking Schlieffen's military thought seriously at a very practical level, instead of accepting that the German ideas of war we commonly hear about were almost insane, informed by marked hubris, or naive and foolish. Zuber looks at the military documents themselves and submits them to a reality test. How could this have worked? Why did Schlieffen write something with so many internal contradictions? Unfortunately, Zuber overreaches the power of his sources and gets things wrong. He also seems to conflate doctrine with strategy. Drawing on his own undoubtedly superb training and extensive experience as a U.S. infantry officer who reached major, he sees things from the perspective of a staff officer or possibly a commander on the battlefield. That is useful, but he forgets what such an officer cannot see, unless he has risen to the very highest levels.</p>\n<p>I was reminded of this weakness today in a combative piece he published in German called \"Der Mythos vom Schlieffenplan\" [in <em>Der Schlieffenplan: Analysen und Dokumente,</em> ed. Hans Ehlert, Michael Epkenhans und Gerhard P. Gross (Paderborn, Ferdinand Sch√∂ningh, 2006), 45‚Äì78]. In the very last paragraph, he writes, <em>\"Krieg und Kriegsvorbereitung sind eine durch und durch n√ºchterne, praktische Angelegenheit. Es geht um Doktrin, Ausbildung, Truppenst√§rke, Beurteilung der Feindlage, zur Verf√ºgung stehende Zeit sowie Gel√§nde und Wetter.\"</em> I hesitate to translate an American's thoughts back into English with quotation marks around them, but his basic point is that war is a fairly straightforward thing. Its core elements are doctrine, training, troop strength, assessment of the hostile forces as well as basic factors like time, terrain, and weather. That sounds like a perfect description of war conceived at the purely operational level, which is the only, albeit important level he examines. But what about strategy? What about politics and economics?</p>\n<p>It might seem uncollegial to bring up Zuber's military background, since he is also a trained historian, but he has made a lot of his military profession, which he uses in ad hominem attacks on his history colleagues. In the same piece I just quoted, for example, he dismisses Annika Mombauer's important findings on <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Helmuth-Origins-Studies-European-History/dp/0521019567/\">Helmut von Moltke</a> the Younger with the remark that she does not understand the terminology and has no military background, whereas he served twenty years in the army. [See Ehlert et al., eds., pp. 45‚Äì46.]</p>\n<p>There's a reason why U.S. officers (and other officials) attend the War College before they enter the highest ranks of service. They need to expand their vision to the strategic level, which will include politics, economics, and more. [See the War College's description of what kinds of leaders it trains: <a href=\"https://dde.carlisle.army.mil/LLL/DSC/readings/L2_chilcoat.pdf\">\"Master of the Strategic Art\"</a>.] Zuber's own military background cannot have provided him with these insights, although his historical training should have. Indeed, I expect he has plenty of knowledge about such issues, but he refuses to engage the problem of German war planning at that level, instead insisting on the sole relevance of the factors quoted above.</p>\n<p>That is unfortunate. To make any real progress in the Schlieffen Plan debate, we need to expand the scope of the discussion to include images of war, ours and those of our historical subjects. Without a firm grasp of such matters, we will talk past each other.</p>\n<h3>Postscript, February 12, 2012</h3>\n<p>A useful article on the Schlieffen Plan debate that I managed to miss when I was finishing my dissertation is Annika Mombauer, ‚ÄúOf War Plans and War Guilt: The Debate Surrounding the Schlieffen Plan,‚Äù <em>Journal of Strategic Studies</em> 28, no. 5 (2005): 857‚Äì85. She, too, points out Zuber‚Äôs apparent disdain for those without significant military experience.</p>\n<p>Regarding the notion of making progess in the dabate, a great deal has been made, of course, and Annika Mombauer might be right to consider Zuber‚Äôs challenge over and done with as far as serious scholarship is concerned. (See her article in the <em>Journal of Strategic Studies</em> cited in my previous comment.) But we haven‚Äôt got to the point where a general consensus has been reached. And I suspect the great number of publications by Zuber will continue to sow confusion for a long time to come, as he insists on the primary value of his limited source base and his narrow conception of war. After all, academic historians do not have a monopoly on the interpretation and telling of history in the public sphere.</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<img src=\"https://mrstoneman.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a7d68afe7c.jpg\" /> \n",

This site was once a personal blog in which I politicized, philosophized, and mused about the economic crisis that began hurting people some five years ago; about the presidential race that led to a wonderful, if cold inauguration day here in Washington, DC in 2008; and, less frequently, about aspects out of my everyday life, past and present. I've saved that stuff for my own records, but I don't know what purpose it serves on the web. I blog to make sense of things or tell stories or both, but I don't do so with the sensibilities of a diarist or archivist.</p>\n\n<p>For the same reason, there are also a few thousand tweets missing from the early days of my <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mstoneman\">twitter</a> account‚Äîthough I understand that the Library of Congress might have preserved that junk. No matter. In the past I've deleted teaching blogs, a Mac blog, and a tumblelog that outlived their usefulness for me. Whether or not they got cached somewhere doesn't matter to me. I just didn't feel like maintaining them or having them show up in current search results.

For starters, I would like to dust off the old dissertation, which I defended in 2006, and ponder what I might do with that research.

				"content_text": "<p>When confronted with history too narrowly conceived or framed, I often think back to one graduate course I took, \"Issues in British Literature,\" which challenged me on a number of levels. To start with, the British historiography we learned seemed to have nothing in common with what I had encountered for German, French, and Russian history. Of course, different countries and different histories were involved, but not even the language or categories of analysis employed in the British historiography were as familiar as I expected them to be. This circumstance did not stop the authors from writing history and arguing with each other as if the assumptions that informed their language were self-explanatory. Their writings offered an odd mixture of history as common sense that rejected social theory combined with the expectation that readers should not dare question how they framed and wrote about history, because, well, readers with enough uncommon intelligence and specialized training would understand. The rest should not bother trying.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>(It would help if I offered some examples here, but that would require research, not just memory and experience. Since this blog represents a mere first draft of some thoughts, and perhaps the basis of some conversations, I will just press on.)</p>\n<p>For me, this situation was about much more than trying to find my footing in a new historiographical space. I wanted to take the material and integrate it into a kind of European history. How else was I to make sense of the modern German, French, British, and Russian history in which I would later take my comprehensive exams? But I don't think I ever learned to put these histories and historiographies together while taking courses and preparing for exams. Not until confronted with the challenge of teaching survey courses did I begin to accomplish the task of putting together histories, but still not historiographies. Some twelve years after taking those exams, it is still an ongoing challenge.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever I contributed to class discussion in the British history course, I tried to relate what I was reading to how I understood German history. Since the class was big, everything I said had to be squeezed into short soundbites, whenever I got a chance to speak. There was not enough time for substantial dialogue, just for proving one had done the reading and was thinking about it. The sum of all our contributions was frequently disjointed. Indeed, integrating ideas from my own historiographical experience was a hazardous undertaking, because others‚Äîincluding the professor‚Äîdid not share the same historiographical backgrounds and therefore could not necessarily understand my own language and assumptions. Unfortunately, I did not realize at the time how far many of us had already embarked on a journey of national specialization that made it difficult to talk across national historiographies with each other. It took my comprehensive exams to make that point painfully clear.</p>\n<p>Thoughts like these come up when I am confronted with historiography that insists on its right to talk in a code that only other specialists will understand. I have seen a lot of rhetoric about the desirability of comparative, transnational, and global history, but often the same scholars use language that narrows their audience to a size too small to spark the kind of discourses necessary to analyze and narrate history across the national and disciplinary boundaries to which our training and research too often confine us.</p>\n<p>The course in British history did not just introduce me to the shortcomings of history and historiography, which until then had appeared more coherent to me than they really were. While frustrating my efforts to talk across national boundaries, it challenged me to integrate a variety of approaches and questions within the narrower, but still rich field of British history itself. Our writing assignment for the semester was to write a paper that drew on every book and article we had read for the class, including cultural history, political history, social history, economic history, and foreign policy from the early eighteenth through the mid-twentieth century. We could write about anything we wanted, but we had to think of some sort of narrative that could draw on incredibly disparate material.</p>\n\n<p>I decided that Britain's history was unusual in comparison to the rest of Europe's, because, despite all its eighteenth-century riots, it was the only state I knew that escaped revolution in modern times. There was my topic: social stability. And it worked. Whereas my discussion contributions convinced the professor that I knew little, the paper succeeded‚Äînot as history for other historians, but as an exercise in synthesis, which historians need to be able to do, but which we too rarely do, since acquiring historical expertise seems to require extreme specialization. That course taught me that I could integrate seemingly disparate historiography after all, albeit not on the fly in that kind of classroom context. It also taught me that such synthesis is not only desirable, but possible, even in unlikely situations. That goes not only for teaching, but also when trying to communicate specialized knowledge to colleagues with expertise in other areas.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>In \"<a href=\"http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/121490\">History without Reading</a>,\" Jim Cullen talks about a dirty little truth: a lot of students in our courses do not read, but we teach the courses as if they had done the reading, thereby only making things worse, because the students are getting nothing out of their classroom time. He suggests that it should be possible to teach history and historical thinking in such a way that we do not assume that the reading has been done. One reason students do not read, he says, is that we teach history assuming that it is obvious why one would want to study history, instead of trying to sell the relevance of history to students in the first place. Indeed, \"so much of history education, from middle school through college, is a matter of going through the motions.\" Cullen suggests that we not accept that and instead asks, \"What would it actually mean to teach a course that presumed ignorance or indifference rather than one of preparation and engagement?\"</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Much of my teaching makes just this assumption, because the Western Civilization survey that I regularly teach is a general education requirement at George Mason University. People have to take it, whether they want to or not. I usually ask myself how I can teach a given class in a way that lets everyone get something out of it, no matter how well prepared they are. Of course, a well-done presentation can convey information to everyone, if they are engaged in it, but working with source material, visual or short texts, is often more helpful. Still, if the assumption that students read too little, if at all, frequently guides my preparation for individual classes, I refuse to accept it as a premise for a whole course. In the end, I want students to read, because it is impossible to do everything in class, and much of history is about reading and critical thinking. I want students to read and connect this reading to what goes on in class, and I want to hold students accountable for that reading.</p>\n\n<p>Hence, last semester I began doing regular \"surprise\" reading quizzes. I usually posed the questions in a way that allowed students to answer in five minutes in a paragraph or with bullet points. Some questions would work if students had just done an internet search on the subject, but rising above a very low grade required actual reading. In the end, the carrot and sick that is the reading quiz seemed to work; however, it also increased the grading workload considerably, which is why I plan to vary formats in the coming semester. (See <a href=\"http://markstoneman.com/2010/01/07/plagiarism-again/\">Plagiarism Again</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Of course, doing things this way feeds into a system of rewards and punishments that still does not get across to students the value of studying history. I still need to convey why we are doing the work and even encourage them to want to do it. But relying on these factors alone does not seem to be enough, not even for the most engaged students in an elective history course.</p>\n\n<p>Last week I listened to Daniel Pink talk about <a href=\"http://thekojonnamdishow.org/shows/2010-01-05/rethinking-carrots-sticks-science-motivation\">rethinking traditional carrots and sticks in the workplace</a>. Pink argued that our minds and hearts do not always follow such logic, and employers could get more out of us with more nuanced approaches. His ideas found their limit, however, when a philosophy professor called in. Pink thought the professor was right to use the carrot-and-stick approach there, because it would work. On the other hand, the fact that the caller felt the need to ask indicated a certain level of dissatisfaction with her own approach, as I feel with mine. Pink himself added the caveat that students who learned only to react to incentives and sanctions would be ill-prepared for many workplaces that required more autonomy and initiative.</p>\n\n<p>This last concern worries me, but maybe it is okay to ignore it in my large survey courses. After all, undergraduate education includes more independent work too, once students advance and specialize. Moreover, just getting to class and fulfilling the requirements of the General Education courses can help to train students in other ways, both intellectually and in terms of life habits such as self-discipline and task management.</p>\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"fontSize\":\"small\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">This post originally appeared on <em>Clio and Me</em> (<a href=\"https://markstoneman.com/2014/11/23/housekeeping/\">now closed</a>) on on this date.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>\n<!-- /wp:pb/accordion-item -->\n",

I might live to regret the attempt, since the course is only one semester long, but I have decided to try the abridged version of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Civilization-West-Penguin-Academic-Combined/dp/0205664733/\">Mark Kishlansky et. al., <em>Civilization in the West</em> (Penguin Academics)</a>. Trying to squeeze everything into the syllabus was much harder this way, even after skipping the first 200 pages of the text, but I am hoping the textbook will assist me in conveying a better sense of the chronological terrain. I have never been against textbooks in principal. I just have not found them to be practical for a one-semester course of this kind. Will this book fit the bill? Ideally, of course, someone would write a shorter book specifically for this kind of class. Abridged histories are usually still too long. Nonetheless, I am hoping that this halfway affordable text will prove to be an exception.</p>\n\n<p>There are two other reasons I am changing things. First, doing so might help to minimize chances of plagiarism, since there will not be a similar set of assignments already in circulation on campus. Second, change keeps my teaching fresh.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p class=\"callout\">Earlier this month I did a post on my Hist 100 blog that might be of some interest to readers here [on Clio and Me], \"Contemporary Politics and History.\" My audience was primarily freshmen in their first semester at university, most of them too young to have voted in the last election.</p>\n\n<p>I have said this in class, but it needs repeating here: Our contemporary American political discourse about socialism and nazism has absolutely nothing to do with those terms and phenomena in actual history. While we are not in class to talk about American politics, I want to point out how language and history are being abused for political purposes. I am not doing this to undermine the stances of politicians who use hyperbole to make their points. There are perfectly good ideological and policy reasons that one can bring to either side of the health care debate, the energy policy debate, environmental policy debates, and so on. But none of these reasons has anything to do with Hitler, nazism, communism, or socialism‚Äînot if we are being honest, and as long as we are willing to see the slippery slope argument for what it is, a logical fallacy.</p>\n\n<p>This abuse of history used to just offend me as a citizen who knew something about history, but addressing the abuse became part of my teaching job this summer when I had a student try to explain Hitler in terms of \"socialism\" and \"big government.\" That is when I realized that not only was history being abused for political purposes, but our contemporary political discourse was getting in the way of students understanding the past. That's why I wrote a blog post on my own history blog sarcastically entitled, \"<a href=\"http://markstoneman.com/2009/08/28/what-having-a-socialist-nazi-in-the-white-house-means-for-the-classroom/\">What Having a Socialist Nazi in the White House Means for the Classroom</a>.\"</p>\n\n<p>I could follow the logic of the student who described Hitler in terms of \"socialism\" and \"big government,\" if I were willing to understand the past in terms of this country's contemporary self-image, but I am not. We need to take the past on its own terms and try to understand it in some detail before we attempt easy analogies. In other words, my concern relates to historical thinking, that is, that thing I began teaching you with the reading assignments from August 31st, including <a href=\"https://www.geraldschlabach.net/resources/courses/handouts/sense-of-history/\">Gerald Schlabach's \"A Sense of History.\"</a></p>\n",

Apparently, however, I need to keep this rhetoric in mind when planning my classes for it has entered my classroom in an unexpected way. In a blue book essay about totalitarianism this summer, one student explained nazism in terms of ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù and ‚Äúbig government.‚Äù There was no political intent behind these statements. The student simply drew on the language of everyday life, as students are wont to do.</p>\n\n<p>This is a sad commentary on what rhetorical excess on the right is doing to our everyday vocabulary, but it also presents an opportunity. Without engaging in politicking, I can use this apparent linguistic and cultural deficit not only as motivation to be more thorough about how I teach socialism, nazism, and other modern political ideologies and systems, but also as an example for historical thinking. My instinct here is to talk about the use and abuse of history, which is probably what I will do. On the other hand, however, some of those who throw around the ‚Äús‚Äù word really believe that socialism is on the march in the United States. If I were to take such fears seriously, I would also use them to teach my students about how the meaning of language shifts and even mutates over time, sometimes meaning different things to different groups of people. This too would be a worthwhile lesson, although it would bring me closer to something that some students might perceive as politicking. I should probably take that chance.</p>\n",

I‚Äôm more interested in learning how concrete decisions are being made, with or without the GOP. Not surprisingly then, I enjoyed Roger Simon‚Äôs opinion piece in Politico today,[\"Obama‚Äôs bold. What did you expect?\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20090306210333/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19534.html)\n\nOne other thing has kept me from editorializing here more of late. The sheer size and complexity of the economic and foreign policy tasks facing us defies easy answers. Fortunately, we have an administration that gets that, even as it moves forward with amazing speed.\n",

He argues that high school students in the bottom half of their class should think twice before entering a four-year college. A two-year college or non-degree program might be more appropriate. He bases this advice on the following disheartening finding: \"Among high-school students who graduated in the bottom 40 percent of their classes, and whose first institutions were four-year colleges, two-thirds had not earned diplomas eight and a half years later.\" And they were piling up debt.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Part of the problem, he says, relates to the quality of teaching. Class size, for example, is a problem. How much attention can I give each student in a fifty-person lecture course that sometimes meets for \"small\" group discussions of twenty-five students? My classroom experience, however, suggests that something else is also at work. There seems to be some kind of cultural or educational gap that has not prepared some of my students for the university classroom and university assignments. There are always a handful of students who expect every lecture to be both entertaining and amusing to every student in the classroom. Whatever happened to students just putting up with something that doesn't interest them personally and learning about it anyway? What about basic curiosity and giving something a chance? This past semester two young men surreptitiously texted each other during a forty-five-minute excerpt from Chaplin's hilarious \"Modern Times.\" Is there any hope that such students will ever be interested in anything in the classroom?</p>\n<p>And what about those students who feel that reading assignments are an imposition, as if everything worth knowing were available on <a title=\"Professor Wikipedia (video)\" href=\"http://clioandme.wordpress.com/2008/09/26/professor-wikipedia/\">Wikipedia</a> or a comparable website? True story: I had a student this semester who preferred to read email and texts on her smart phone instead of listening to the lecture. Usually when students do this, they try to be discrete about it, even if their facial expressions give them away. This student, however, held the phone up in front of her face so there could be no mistaking where her attention was. When I spoke to her about it another time, she said she was using the phone for the internet so she could bring something to the discussion. I told her I knew the little bit that was on the internet for our subject and that I was more interested in her own thoughts on the assigned book. She was flabbergasted.</p>\n<p>These complaints of mine can lead to a slippery slope. I can't forget all the hard-working, disciplined, and curious students I know. I don't want to succumb to the cynicism that pervades <a href=\"http://rateyourstudents.blogspot.com/\">Rate Your Students</a>, a blog where some academics vent about their students and colleagues. It really is up to me to make the best I can out of a situation, even for the Sisyphean task of teaching the required one-semester survey in Western Civilization. Indeed, I think I've become a better teacher for these experiences. Still, Marty Nemko has a point, even if the fault does not just lie with institutions selling the dream of a four-year degree. There is clearly a gulf separating the expectations of a portion of the student body from the expectations that they encounter in the classroom. While many colleges and universities need to be more student-centered, prospective students need to consider whether a four-year college is the right choice for them. It is for many people, but not for everyone.</p>\n",

It examines why soldiers sometimes departed from generally accepted standards in Europe about sparing civilians the effects of war as much as possible.</p>\n\n<p>The war began as a \"cabinet war\" that the German leadership hoped to win quickly through a series of decisive battles of annihilation. In this way the state, led by the king and his cabinet, would maintain control over the war effort and not face any undue influence from civilians, whether its own or those of the enemy. After destroying the Second Empire's army at Sedan, however, France refused to capitulate. Its people toppled the empire and vowed to fight on. The German leadership had a \"people's war\" on its hands that it took five more months to win. While the French and Germans fought most of this war with conventional means between armed forces organized by the state, the war also saw substantial civilian involvement that had the potential to lead to an ever deepening spiral of violence.</p>\n<p>The most extensive contact between soldiers and civilians occurred as a result of the German military policy of living off the land, which made German forces more mobile. To maintain discipline, officers were supposed to take small details of soldiers to requisition what animals, fodder, and food their units required. Requisitioning resembled theft in that those whose property the German officers took had no choice in the matter, but it differed insofar as the German officers issued receipts for what they took. These would be paid off by whichever side lost. German forces were also quartered on civilian households. These circumstances enabled soldiers to pursue their own private initiatives. If their \"hosts\" would not give them what they needed, the soldiers often took it.</p>\n<p>More famous, however, were reports of armed French civilians called francs-tireurs. While their number was not great enough to present a strategic threat, the German forces did have to devote some 120,000 soldiers to their lines of communication. Armed incidents led the invading soldiers to shoot suspected partisans summarily, burn down houses and even villages where such incidents occurred, and use hostages, most famously on locomotives. While some reactions had an ad hoc quality to them, the common thread was the notion of \"military necessity.\" The German forces found the actions regrettable but necessary, in order to prevent the war from lasting longer than necessary. The idea was to counter French \"terror\" with measures so harsh that the French would see the error of their ways and refrain from any further resistance.</p>\n<p>References for these incidents and the historiography of the Franco-Prussian War are available in this new essay as well as the following related one, in which I devote a lot of space to the events in Bazailles, which the Bavarians infamously burned down during the Battle of Sedan: \"The Bavarian Army and French Civilians in the War of 1870‚Äì1871: A Cultural Interpretation,\" <em>War in History</em> 8.3 (2001): 271‚Äì93.</p>\n<p>My source base for this research was published personal narratives, that is, letters, diaries, and memoirs. Most of them came from Bavarian soldiers and officers, though I drew on other German narratives by way of comparison. It is in some ways surprising how freely the fighting men wrote about these events, but what they were describing was either acceptable in their minds or told in relation to what lines they believed the French had crossed.</p>\n<p>One phenomenon I found little mention of was the hostage-taking. This might be because the Bavarian veterans felt they had crossed a line, although it is also worth noting that their units were not as heavily involved in maintaining lines of communication in the rear, which is where the hostage-taking occurred. Recently I learned more about this subject from <a href=\"http://www.hsozkult.de/hfn/publicationreview/id/rezbuecher-10944\">Heidi Mehrkens' new book</a>, which includes a section on the German military using hostages on locomotives. Mehrkens' book is also helpful, because it uses archival sources that confirm the impressions I gained about relations between soldiers and civilians from the published primary sources.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\"/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1767-1\">Mark R.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I had a new personal record in plagiarism cases this semester: eight. With ninety-seven students total on my rolls at the end of the semester, that makes a little over 8%. To be absolutely clear, I am talking about open-and-shut cases. The burden of proof is on the professor, as it should be, so I never report any honor system violations based merely on my suspicions, no matter how strong they might be.</p>\n<p>Some of the cases stem from this semester's new <a title=\"Lessons from the Classroom [Clio and Me]\" href=\"http://markstoneman.com/2008/08/26/lessons-from-the-classroom/\">bibliography project</a>. In the past I had tried to craft integrative essay assignments that made plagiarism impossible or very difficult, but I had wanted to move beyond text analysis and writing to also cover research skills, which have proven to be a major deficit among many of my students. I had thought a bibliography project would invite less plagiarism than a straight research paper, since I have not seen bibliography essays for sale on the internet. I was right about buying a finished product, but not about preventing plagiarism. Feeling overwhelmed, a few students panicked and opted to copy and paste material they found on the internet. These examples were the clumsiest. I also saw some examples where students worked harder to integrate internet material than they would have had to work, had they simply opened some books and summarized their contents. I saw both types of behavior on the other essay assignments too.</p>\n<p>What happens to these students depends on whether it is their first or second offense. The first offenses that I have seen have led to a zero for the assignment in question. Since these are often worth 25% of the course grade, students found guilty of their first honor system violation have to work hard just to earn a \"D\" in the course. Second offenses have led to failure of the course. Perhaps there were also other sanctions for second-time offenders that I do not know about.</p>\n<p>The high number of plagiarism cases has made me wonder what I could change about assignments and assessment in future. Since I am not slated to teach this spring, I have some time to mull this over. Meanwhile, what are your thoughts and experiences?</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p class=\"callout\">The following post originally appeared on Language for You (now closed) on on this date under a slightly different title.</p>\n\n<p>When learning a foreign language, it is important to practice daily or even more frequently than that. Many readers will say, \"But I don't have time for that!\" Sure you do! Really. You just have to let go of the habit of doing a lot of homework and studying all in one long weekly session. Do many short sessions instead. If you only have two hours a week to devote to learning a new language, you could break part of that time up into shorter chunks. You could, for example, take one hour for a long study session. And then you could divide the other hour into four 15-minute sessions. That would give you a total of five sessions in a week. Add to that the class you are probably taking, and you are up to six sessions per week. That will give you the repetition you need to make new words, grammar, and habits of thought sink in. This little amount of time is not ideal. More studying is desirable, but it will bring you a better return on your investment than one long session per week.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, once you get into the habit of these short study sessions, you will find that you can schedule more. What about the five or ten minutes you spend waiting for a bus or train? What about the time you spend on the train? What about when you're walking? You can't look at your books then, but you could look at flash cards with idioms, confusing words, or irregular verbs. You could also simply try thinking in the language you are learning. In this way, the two hours you spend learning the language will grow substantially without actually costing you extra time. And because you are studying frequently and regularly, your brain and mouth and ears will grow accustomed to the language more quickly.</p>\n\n<p>And you know what? It can be fun. It takes your mind off your daily troubles and lets you accomplish something in a short period of time. Pretty soon you will notice that you can feel good about this activity, which gives you one more reason to feel good about yourself. These positive feelings will spark you to keep up and even expand this new study habit.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->",
				"content_text": "<p>My Western Civ courses last winter and spring had some mandatory discussion components. Students had to visit the Holocaust Museum and talk about their experience online. I had them do the same with two old movies as well. (They chose from a list I had given them.) Both assignments went pretty well, except for a couple students who thought they only needed to copy and paste someone's words from an online movie review. The other downside to the assignment was assessment. <a href=\"http://www.blackboard.com/\">Blackboard</a> gives precise statistics for each user, so it is possible to combine one's impression of the students' quality of effort with numbers. <a href=\"http://www.wikispaces.com/\">Wikispaces</a>, which I like, did not offer these statistics. (It might for its <a title=\"Wikispaces\" href=\"http://www.wikispaces.com/site/privatelabel\">Private Label</a> version, but <a title=\"George Mason University\" href=\"http://www.gmu.edu\">my school</a> doesn't have that. I had to set up my own Wikispaces account.)</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>What was really interesting about the Wikispaces experience, however, was that students started using the discussion feature in other parts of the course. It wasn't mandatory, though I had told students I'd keep it in mind when doing their class participation grade. I've said the same thing to classes where I have used Blackboard, but without such positive results. The difference was related both to Wikispaces and the number of students involved.</p>\n<p>Wikispaces lets people stay logged in on their laptops or desktop computers. That makes it really easy to check on a regular basis. Wikispaces also makes it easy to create course content that is easy to navigate. Blackboard makes creating course content much more difficult, at least that's been my experience with their folders. I put course content in them and then got all kinds of emails asking where the stuff was. I never had that happen on Wikispaces. Obviously, I could learn to use Blackboard more effectively, but that will cost me more time than I've had, and the process of building pages will continue to be clumsy and slow. Wikispaces is so much easier, especially with one learns it's easy markup, though that is not necessary.</p>\n<p>My experience with Wikispaces forums was different for another reason, however. Last spring I put together all three courses on one Wiki. That gave me about 110 people. Since the course is required and not everyone is as interested in online participation, or even familiar with online forums, these numbers gave me the critical mass I needed to get self-sustaining discussions that did not require too much shepherding on my part.</p>\n<p>By way of comparison, this fall I am using Blackboard again, because I did not feel like paying Wikispaces any money or dealing with student usernames. (Neither of these things would be an issue if the university bought the service for the whole campus.) The result has been mixed. I have not required online participation because of the bibliography project, but I was hoping to see a little discussion about the content of the course like I saw last spring. That has not been happening much. The problem, I think, is that while I have 95 students, they are split into two courses and therefore two places on Blackboard. (I should have asked for consolidation of the two.) This means I lost my critical mass. Also, logging into Blackboard is a pain in the neck. Not only can it not leave one signed in, but it insists on checking browser compatibility every single time. Why can't it just drop a cookie? And Firefox asks me every single time whether I trust the security certificate or not. (Using Safari is not even an option.) These minor things really get in the way, because logging in distracts the user from whatever she might have wanted to say. Adding insult to injury, Blackboard automatically logs one out after a certain amount of time has elapsed, which limits the utility of its note-taking and calendar functions. (I'm not sure how much time has to pass, but the automatic logout has happened to me a lot this semester.)</p>\n<p>One other thing I've noticed is layout. Many students need teaching about threaded discussions, no matter what platform, it seems, but Blackboard's are just plain clunky next to Wikispaces'.</p>\n<p>One important point to note about Wikispaces: The free version does not shield students' comments from the public, and it includes ads via Google AdSense in the right-hand bar. The instructor can gain privacy and get rid of the ads by paying $5.00 per month or $50.00 per year. That is good if one plans to recycle the same site. If not, the number of sites could grow. Sooner or later one will have to release the comments to the public and allow the ads. I knew this was going to happen, so I told students ahead of time that I would be opening the wiki at the end of the semester. I also offered to delete their names, though only one person took me up on that. Of course, none of this is an issue for universities with an enterprise edition. Also, teachers in primary and secondary education can obtain free wikis for their classes.</p>\n<p>Bottom line? I wish more universities would buy <a href=\"http://www.wikispaces.com/site/privatelabel\">Wikispaces Private Label</a>, which is between $1000 and $8000 per year, depending on levels of storage and service. I don't know what Blackboard costs, but I suspect this is a pretty cheap price that would make an invaluable tool available for student collaborative projects as well. And instructors would have control over their course websites and forums in a way that Blackboard users can only dream of. Of course, some instructors might be using Blackboard's testing features, which Wikispaces doesn't have, but I'm not.</p>\n<p><strong>Update (1/7/2010):</strong> I have deleted the wiki initially linked to at the beginning of this post. As interesting as the experience was, I would like to maintain the privacy of the students, and I cannot afford the annual dues to password protect the thing. I do wish that the universities I teach for as an adjunct wer subscribed to the enterprise version of Wikispaces.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Last winter and spring I had my students write Wikipedia articles and then monitor those articles to see what edits other people made. The point was to give them a firmer appreciation of how this online resource works, so that they would understand its strengths and limitations. The Wikipedia projects were of varying quality, but I wasn't unhappy with them. The student feedback at the end of the semester also showed that most of them learned the lesson, though a few were excited to be exposed to this resource for the first time. To be sure, the latter kind of comment made me feel dirty, though I'm sure the students would have found Wikipedia sometime, at the very latest through Google searches, which is how I discovered it some years ago.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>As much as I liked the Wikipedia experiment, I have decided not to repeat it this semester. For one thing, the process of helping 100 or more students find a suitable topic that has not already been done in Wikipedia is enormously time-consuming. So is teaching students how to use Wikipedia's relatively uncomplicated markup. Contrary to the stereotype about the youngest generation of university students being internet savvy, many of them only know how to use the internet in highly specific ways. (If you can read German, see Jan Hodel's comments on this issue <a href=\"http://weblog.histnet.ch/archives/896\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://weblog.histnet.ch/archives/977\">here</a>.) I did not have much time for technical details in class, so I had a lot of one-on-one student meetings in the computer lab. This circumstance does not mean that Wikipedia projects are not worth doing, but it is a significant factor to consider for the kind of large survey course that I have been teaching.</p>\n<p>More to the point, however, the Wikipedia project and especially the group electronic scrapbook project I had students do revealed a more traditional weakness: too many students did not know how to do basic research using the library's catalog, reference desk, and databases. Indeed, they did not know how to use Google very well either. Furthermore, most students did not know how to evaluate the potential usefulness of books they found. They seem to have just assumed that a book was a book. The idea of examining the bibliography, for example, never occurred to many of them, even though I discussed the issue in the directions as well as in class. I thought that this kind of need was supposed to be filled in required English classes, but if that is happening, it is inadequate, because most of my students last semester were not freshman.</p>\n<p>Hence, this semester I have decided to incorporate research skills into my course. A research paper is out of the question with so many students involved. Moreover, a research paper can become a distraction, since students are often most concerned simply with producing enough text. At the same time, I want to do something that gives students some choice, as most students really appreciated that aspect of the course last semester. Hence, I have decided to have students choose a research topic, develop a bibliography and write a short bibliographical essay to go with it. </p>\n<p>I plan to devote some time to research issues in class and on a forum on Blackboard, to which George Mason recently switched from WebCT. Finally, I expect to talk to some students during office hours. Instead of giving technical lessons for Wikipedia markup, however, we will be able to talk research methods and history. Students also need to improve their electronic literacy, but I have to pick my battles.</p>\n<p>Finally, some notes about plagiarism: An unusually high number of students thought they could get away with copying and pasting text for their online scrapbook projects. I instructed them about the university's honor system, but it seems much additional work is necessary in this area, should I ever do electronic assignments again. Interestingly, though, I did not find such copying in the Wikipedia projects. Perhaps students understood that others would be reading that work? Some students actually commented to me on how good it felt to do a homework assignment that they knew others would be reading. Be that as it may, it is possible that this semester's bibliography project will reduce plagiarism opportunities and temptations, since it will not be as readily available on the open market.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Looking back, I am surprised at how easy it was for me to get through high school and many college courses without knowing a lot of basic vocabulary related to English grammar. I knew English grammar intuitively, and I could write, but I could not talk about grammar. I am lucky I knew enough intuitively, for this weakness could have become a real handicap for me in my studies.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, it did become a weakness in one subject: Russian. We had to take a foreign language at Dartmouth College, and I fulfilled the requirement with Russian. But I was horrible. I do not believe that I ever rose above a C+. Part of the problem was study habits and discipline, but much of it related to my lack of appreciation of the nature of grammar. The professors used terms like genitive case, dative case, direct object, personal pronoun, possessive pronoun, conjugate, and decline, and it seemed like I had to devote too much energy to understanding that vocabulary and the things it indicated instead of learning Russian. Or I missed points entirely because I did not recognize their significance.</p>\n\n<p>I only appreciated this dilemma later, after I took a break from Dartmouth and came back. During my time away I was in the army and stationed in Germany, where I learned to get by with rudimentary German. Upon returning to Dartmouth I decided I would like to learn German properly. My experience was enhanced considerably by a practical little book by Cecile Zorach entitled <em>English Grammar for Students of German</em>. It explained the way English grammar worked for certain situations and then compared it to German. It was through these comparisons that I began to gain an appreciation of the mechanics of English grammar and a vocabulary with which to talk about it. This knowledge later served me well when I found myself in Munich teaching English to Germans. Of course, the learning process never ended.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Sometimes history just leaps off the pages and proclaims its relevance for our own times. On December 24, 1894, <em>The Times</em> of London published a long editorial about the first trial of Captain Alfred Dreyfus for alleged treason.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We must point out that, the more odious and unpopular a crime is, the more necessary is it that its proof and its punishment should be surrounded by all the safeguards of public justice. Of these, the most indispensable is publicity. . . . It may be important for the French people to preserve the secrets of their War Department, but it is of infinitely greater importance for them to guard their public justice against even the suspicion of unfairness or of subjection to the gusts of popular opinion.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <em>Times</em> correspondent wrote these words when there was still little doubt of Dreyfus' guilt in the public at large. There were no Drefusards yet, that is, members of a movement to see the wrongfully convicted man exonerated. It was three years before <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2008/03/30/when_zola_wrote_jaccuse/\">Emile Zola wrote \"J'accuse.\"</a> The point wasn't about guilt or innocence. It was about the rule of law, which meant due process out in the open even for grave matters of national security. The later establishment of Dreyfus' innocence reminded observers why.</p>\n\n<p>Tomorrow my class is discussing Michael Burns, <em>France and the Dreyfus Affair: A Documentary History</em> (Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 1999). Burns tells this dramatic tale with his own gripping prose interspersed with documents from the period. And he extends the tale as far as 1998, in order to help readers understand the affair's legacy. For those with more time on their hands I also recommend Jean Denis Bredin, <em>The Affair: The Case of Alfred Dreyfus</em>, trans. Jeffrey Mehlman (New York: George Braziller, 1986), a big history book that reads like a good political thriller.</p>\n",

Several recent posts include criticism of efforts by modern-day Confederate patriots and would-be historians who want to appropriate <a href=\"http://cwmemory.com/tag/weary-clyburn/\">Weary Clyburn</a>, a slave, as a defender of Southern liberty. In one he points out that writing good books to debunk myths is all well and good, but on the subject of black Confederates \"<a href=\"http://cwmemory.com/2008/07/16/weary-clyburn-and-black-confederates-where-do-we-go-from-here/\">the real fight must take place on the web</a>.\"</p>\n\n<p>In the same post he points to an earlier one he made in late March: \"<a href=\"http://cwmemory.com/2008/03/28/should-civil-war-historians-blog-academic-that-is/\">Should Civil War Historians Blog (academic that is)?</a>\" In it he observes how vast the public discourse about the American Civil War is, while the discourse in which professional historians participate is relatively narrow. Historians need to continue their current research and publishing mission, but they also have \"a responsibility to engage a wider audience and contribute to the public discourse.\" Since much of the public turns to the internet for ready answers, historians need to offer these answers in an accessible format, especially for highly sensitive questions that shape American identity.</p>\n\n<p>I agree with Kevin about the need for Civil War historians to blog. I have also observed a similar need with respect to Holocaust denial, since I have found that <a href=\"http://markstoneman.com/2008/01/10/when-google-gets-it-wrong/\">Google can get it wrong</a>. Until now I have used this blog mainly to reflect on what I do and to communicate with other historians, but as Kevin points out, Google brings him search engine traffic for important topics such as black Confederates, so his blog posts reach a wider audience. I have written a few of my posts with that awareness, but his arguments make me think I could do much more.

Apparently \"American military and intelligence officers\" (he is not more specific) decided in 2002 to examine Cold War CIA studies of Chinese interrogation methods during the Korean War. After all, these Communists were the supposed masters who fed the kinds of fears that later gave rise to a movie like \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manchurian_Candidate_%281962_film%29\">The Manchurian Candidate</a>.\" In one major study the officers found examples of what are now often called \"<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1322866\">harsh interrogation techniques</a>\" when the more negatively valued term \"torture\" is being deliberately avoided. \"They reprinted a 1957 chart describing death threats, degradation, sleep deprivation‚Äîand worse‚Äîinflicted by Chinese captors. And they made it part of a new handbook for interrogators at Guant√°namo.\"</p>\n<p>The provenance of these techniques might give pause, but here's the real bombshell:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The irony is that the original author of that chart, Albert D. Biderman, a social scientist who had distilled interviews with 235 Air Force P.O.W.‚Äôs, wrote that the Communists‚Äô techniques mainly served to ‚Äúextort false confessions.‚Äù And they were the same methods that ‚Äúinquisitors had employed for centuries.‚Äù They had done nothing that ‚Äúwas not common practice to police and intelligence interrogators of other times and nations.‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This story reminds me of the student who hurriedly pulls a bunch of quotes from a book without actually reading or studying the book as a whole, let alone thinking about its historical context. The student then slaps the material together in a paper that might confirm his own beliefs, but whose conclusions bear no tangible relationship to the source that he supposedly read and analyzed. Is that what happened here? Or was the document perhaps too complex for them? Perhaps they needed to invest in some historians who were not afraid to dig through this kind of thing in an honest manner, no matter what conclusions the documents might suggest.</p>\n",

On this day, 232 years ago, thirteen American colonies proclaimed their independence from Great Britain in a famous document that Thomas Jefferson wrote, the Declaration of Independence. As a history teacher, I find this document fascinating, because it fuses together two different political traditions. On one hand, it recalls seventeenth-century English constitutionalism and its arguments about what had supposedly always been the rights of Englishmen. On the other hand, it advances the kind of powerful and universalizing claims about natural law and human rights spawned in the Enlightenment and given their most dramatic expression during the French Revolution. These connections make the document an interesting object lesson for the history classroom. They also can act as a healthy reminder to Americans that our Declaration of Independence displays not only differences from European political traditions, but also powerful affinities for them.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>For traditions of English constitutionalism, have a look at the second half of the second paragraph of the <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/declare.asp\">Declaration of Independence</a>, which speaks of \"a long train of abuses and usurpations\" and ends thus: \"The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.\" Following this statement is a list of all the King's offenses.</p>\n<p>Now compare this list as well as the language complaining of tyranny to the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sourcebookofengl00leeg/page/348/mode/2up\">Petition of Right</a>, which the English parliament issued in 1628 in response to perceived abuses of power by King Charles I, who a couple decades later fought a civil war and was eventually tried for treason and <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20040408013742/http://www3.baylor.edu/BIC/WCIII/Essays/charles.1.html\">beheaded</a> in 1649. To understand the gulf in political culture between Parliament and the King, it is also helpful to look at a statement that the king's father, James I, wrote in 1598, while still just James VI of Scotland: <a href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/james1-trew2.html\">True Law of Free Monarchies</a>. In it the king is a divine right ruler who sees himself as \"before any estates or ranks of men within the same, before any Parliaments were holden or laws made; and by them was the land distributed (which at the first was wholly theirs), states erected and discerned, and forms of government devised and established.\"</p>\n<p>England tried government without a monarchy for a about a decade, but in 1660 a Stuart, Charles II, once again ascended the throne. His son became King James II in 1688. Fears of the son's absolutist ambitions and attempts to bring Catholicism back to England led Parliament to depose him, and invite his daughter and son-in-law to rule, William and Mary. This time Parliament passed a much more far-reaching bill, the <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/england.asp\">English Bill of Rights</a> of 1689, to which the new King and queen acquiesced. Nonetheless, Parliament did not claim to have the right to depose kings. Instead, it observed that James II had \"abdicated the government and the throne [was] thereby vacant.\" After discussing his offenses, the members of the upper and lower houses of Parliament declared that \"for the vindicating and asserting [of] their [the representatives'] ancient rights and liberties,\" kings could not rule without Parliament on their royal authority alone. The king was subject to the law. Then the document enumerates a series of rights that will look familiar to anyone who knows the first ten amendments of the <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.overview.html\">United States Constitution</a>.</p>\n<p>Jefferson's Declaration of Independence describes similar tyranny, and his explanation for the colonists' rebellion is not inconsistent with what Parliament had done eighty-eight years earlier. It represented not so much a revolution, per se, as a severing of relations with the king, in order to preserve traditional rights. Jefferson's own argument read thus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the Declaration of Independence was consistent with English constitutionalist traditions, however, it also offered a powerful and universal statement about human beings that was based on natural law instead of ancient liberties.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote >\n<p>That all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This kind of thinking was indeed revolutionary. In France beliefs in natural law soon helped bring down the old regime in 1789, though the American contribution to that was probably more the debts that Louis XVI had incurred in his support of the enemies of his enemy, Great Britain, during the American rebellion. Members of the Third Estate called the National Assembly into existence, and members of this body began their work by focusing on individual rights, only later turning to more practical constitutional issues. In contrast to England in 1688 and later the American colonies in 1776, though, the French didn't modify an existing form of government. They invented something new based on natural law. Read the <a href=\"http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/295/\">Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen</a>, which appeared during the first summer of revolution. The first three items in this document will sound familiar to Americans who know their own country's foundational documents:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be based only on common utility.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2. The purpose of all political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>3. The principle of all sovereignty rests essentially in the nation. No body and no individual may exercise authority which does not emanate expressly from the nation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The causal link between this document and our own Constitution and Declaration of Independence is indirect at best, but one can see the common concerns that had arisen from the Enlightenment, and the common justification for people coming together and forming a new political order of their own free will.</p>\n<p>The Declaration of Independence has a foot in two different traditions, one of old English rights that Parliament asserted and expanded in the face of the absolutist ambitions of its kings, and one more universal, based on natural law and reflected not only in the ideals of the French Revolution, but also the 1948 <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/universaldeclara00unit\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>. It is tempting to speculate on how these two different traditions might continue to inform American political culture today, but that will have to wait for another time and perhaps another author. Important here is rather the conversation among foundational constitutional documents from the United States, England, and France.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I have been teaching History 100, the one-semester survey of Western Civilization that is required for all students at <a href=\"http://www.gmu.edu\">George Mason University</a>. Yes, really. One semester. As I mentioned earlier, this semester I decided to abandon the old chronological approach and follow a thematic one instead. I organized the course into six major themes, plus an introductory unit on historical thinking. One of those themes was \"Politics and Human Rights.\"</p>\n<p>If one looks at Western Civ textbooks or the reading lists from my days as a graduate student, human rights are not going to be an obvious subject of study, especially not for a history survey that can only afford to choose six major topics. Yet they are not only important to learn about, they also offer a powerful integrative vehicle for talking about a variety of issues that have been central to the history of the West since the eighteenth century.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>I took my cue from a nice little collection of primary sources that Lynn Hunt edited and translated: <em>The French Revolution and Human Rights: A Brief Documentary History</em> (Boston and New York: Bedford/St. Martin's, 1996). Of course, people did not use the term \"human rights\" in the eighteenth century, but they did reimagine and rework the relationship between the individual and the state in a fundamental way. The rights that eighteenth-century thinkers and politicians posited and then fought for formed the basis of what we now consider fundamental human rights: freedom of religion and expression, the protection of one's property, and the right to pursue an occupation and earn rewards according to one's talents, not birth. Government existed to protect these and other rights, not according to the whims of a monarch above the law.</p>\n<p>The English gained such rights based on the accumulation of precedents over time. Milestones included the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/magna-carta\">Magna Carta</a> (1215) and the <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/england.asp\">English Bill of Rights</a> (1689). Rights grew more expansive, but they adhered to Englishmen as Englishmen. Enlightenment thought, on the other hand, was characterized by its universality. Men had rights by virtue of their common humanity. Thomas Jefferson reflected both traditions in the <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration.html\">Declaration of Independence</a> (1776), which enumerated English offenses against the colonists' rights, on one hand, but contained language whose bold universality conveyed a message far beyond its original purpose:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As we know from American history, this famous declaration left many questions unanswered and long went unrealized in society. Who was to be included in this equality? At first it was only all free men. Black slaves were property. There was also the question of property qualifications for voting rights. Could the poor and uneducated be trusted to make the right decisions in a democracy? And what about women? Much of American history can be told as the history of making Jefferson's words become a reality.</p>\n<p>These questions also held great urgency during the <a href=\"http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/\">French Revolution</a>, which offers unparalleled opportunities for students to read about, reflect on, and discuss the major issues thrown up by the advent of citizenship and individual rights. For instead of struggling with the major issues over a period of some two centuries, the revolutionaries in France tried to do it all in a period of only five years, from the onset of the Revolution in 1789 to the end of the Terror in 1794.</p>\n<p>The most enduring document from that time was <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/rightsof.asp\">The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen</a> (1789), but students can also consider Olympes de Gouges' <a href=\"https://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/293/\">Declaration of the Rights of Woman</a> (1791). Besides these and some other famous documents, Hunt's book contains a host of compelling material otherwise unavailable in English. The main point of the exercise is to help students think about where our notions of such rights come from and to understand better their contingent and contested nature in the past.</p>\n<p>Discussing Hunt's book covered one seventy-five minute unit. Two more units entailed a lecture that walked students through these issues in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, along the way exploring the issues of nationalism, feminism, socialism, and totalitarianism. I am still not satisfied with the result, but the topic of human rights lent Europe's confusing political history more narrative coherence than I had been able to muster in the past. It also permitted me to push the issue into the second half of the twentieth century and include the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (1948), decolonization, the <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy-protest/helsinki_2716.jsp\">Helsinki Accords</a> (1975), the collapse of Europe's communist regimes, and the human rights abuses that followed Yugoslavia's breakup.</p>\n<p>My mind was dizzy after such a trip, especially since I use slides but no prepared text. I'm sure some students had trouble with the shifting geography and rapidly advancing timeline. Nonetheless, they were able to follow one theme over the course of two hundred years and see how it touches on nearly every major aspect of history in this time. How many other topics link politics, the economy, gender, race, religion, ideology, party politics, war, and international relations in such clearly important ways? In future I will surely make changes in how I cover the topic, but I will continue to give it an important place in my survey courses.</p>\n",

Usually I‚Äôm too swamped by end-of-the-semester grading. This was true of this year too, but my wife wasn‚Äôt accepting that excuse, and I‚Äôm glad. We managed to see four films this week: ‚ÄúEgg‚Äù [Yumurta] (Semih Kaplanoglu, Turkey/Greece, 2007), ‚ÄúTricks‚Äù [Sztuczki] (Andrzej Jakimowski, Poland, 2007), ‚ÄúThe Edge of Heaven‚Äù [Auf der anderen Seite] (Fatih Akin, Germany/Turkey, 2007), and ‚ÄúWith Your Permission‚Äù [Til Doden os Skiller] (Paprika Steen, Sweden/Denmark, 2007).</p>\n<p>Our favorite movies were ‚ÄúEgg‚Äù and ‚ÄúTricks,‚Äù both of which contained not only humor, but a certain magical quality, where time and stress were suspended. As much happened in the people‚Äôs faces and as in their words. In ‚ÄúEgg‚Äù the looks passed between a man who returned to his hometown to bury his mother and the young woman who had taken care of his mother. In ‚ÄúTricks‚Äù the looks passed between a young boy and his teenage sister, as well as between the boy and the man he was sure was his father. There was also a lot of movement in ‚ÄúTricks‚Äù as the boy explored and played around the train station and town, though most of these actions were part of everyday life, not a dramatic sequence of events. I enjoyed getting lost in the worlds these two films offered.</p>\n<p>We wanted to see ‚ÄúThe Edge of Heaven‚Äù, because we had enjoyed an extremely funny movie by the same directory called ‚ÄúKebab Connection.‚Äù We knew this movie wasn‚Äôt going to be funny, but I was surprised by the unpleasant turns of fate mixed with occasional joy and life‚Äôs refusal to stop moving on. It could have been an excellent, if sometimes confusing movie, had not the distributors sent the film to the theater with the reels in the wrong order. Instead of seeing the movie‚Äôs three parts in the correct order, we saw the middle, then the beginning, then the end. If it had to happen, I suppose this was the movie where it would do the least damage, but it was still disappointing. As it was, I got the story and simple slices of life from Germany and Turkey, but much of the overarching story was lost on me. Afterwards I ended up focusing my attention not on the message, but on trying to re-imagine the film in the correct order. Still not there yet.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWith Your Permission‚Äù is a worthwhile dark comedy with an operatic emotional high point. I‚Äôm glad I saw it, but it was not in the same league with the first two magical films I saw. Nor was it intended to be, I think. It begins with a man who has a black eye from his wife. She beats him more than once and he acts increasingly strange. His boss on the ferry makes him seek help. Unusual twists in the plot with some hilarious characters follow on the way to an emotionally satisfying result.</p>\n<p>I would also like to mention one of the many films we wanted to see but couldn‚Äôt.

Watch too how Moyers is almost mystified by Booker‚Äôs perspective, one Obama shares. Moyers expects to see righteous anger in Booker. He wants Booker to blame all of Newark‚Äôs woes on racism and demand assistance from the federal government, but Booker refuses to follow that path.

				"content_text": "<p>I heard a report on <a href=\"http://marketplace.publicradio.org/\">Marketplace</a> this evening about the high cost of txtbooks and how Congress wants to force publishers to reveal to professors the costs of books they require in their courses. I find it strange that such a measure should be necessary. Is it that hard to figure out what books cost? I use Amazon when writing a syllabus. So do many other cost-conscious professors. And who is this professor they quoted who talked about being courted by publishing representatives with good chocolate in the mailroom and meals out? Certainly no history professor.</p>\n<p>The report blamed the rapidly growing cost of textbooks on an expansion of the used book market because of the internet. Really? Used books sounds right, but to my mind this isn't the internet per se, but rather the chains that sell books in so many university book stores. I don't know what kind of arrangement they have with their host universities, but I wouldn't be surprised if these universities are complicit in the process, insofar as they are earning money from these arrangements.</p>\n<p>Returning to the original topic, it is sometimes hard to tell how much new books will cost students, because publishers can only qoute net prices. In the past I tried to bundle books from a publisher, in order to lower costs. Result: the net price to the bookstore went down, but the bookstore priced the bundle with no discount, because it had to make these books more expensive than the used books it wanted to sell at some two thirds to three quarters of the new price. It earns a higher margin on those, after all.</p>\n<p>Some students at Georgetown University have the right idea. They set up a book coop that collects books at the end of the semester and sells books at the beginning of the next semester at the prices the owners of the books set. I wish George Mason University had something like that. I've tried to help by setting up a Google group on which my students can establish contact with each other for the purpose of buying and selling their books. So far I've had no takers.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Spring is almost here, which means its time to order books for the summer term. Summer in DC gets hot, and the summer terms are short, so I usually try to assign things that are both reasonably entertaining and not too long for the general audience I get in my introductory survey courses that are mandatory requirements for all majors. Besides covering a variety of themes and genres, I often try to pick one book that will jump-start historical thinking. I want a book that will make students more aware of how much <a href=\"http://hnn.us/articles/42835.html\" title=\"Is America a Christian Nation? What Both Left and Right Get Wrong\nby John Fea\">\"the past is like a foreign country\"</a> that we will not understand, if we do not try to fathom the conditions and assumptions of the time without letting our contemporary worldview get in our way.</p>\n\n<p>Last year I tried Bertolt Brecht's <em>Galileo</em>, which I had first experienced as a TA for Sandra Horvath-Peterson at Georgetown University back in the 1990s. Of course, Brecht adapts Galileo's story to his own purposes, but it provides a useful point of departure for a discussion about the Scientific Revolution. It also forces students to come to terms with the limits of historical fiction.</p>\n<p>It usually goes pretty well, though the first section I did it in was a little rocky, partly because not enough students had done the reading, but also because I was surprised that so few people had any general knowledge of fascism. The <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802130593/\">paperback edition</a> we used, translated by Eric Bently, contains some excellent material on Brecht's prejudices, but it spends too much time on material more of interest to specialists in drama. Some students read the first part of it, but most gave up and went straight to the play. So I integrated a mini talk of Brecht's time into the discussions and got them to reason out how the problems of the nineteen thirties and forties had manifested themselves in a play Brecht had set in the seventeenth century. I also assigned sources from <a href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/galileo-tuscany.html\" title=\"Galileo Galilei: Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina of Tuscany, 1615\">1615</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1630galileo.html\" title=\"The Crime of Galileo: Indictment and Abjuration of 1633\">1633</a>, so that they could get a sense of the issues from Galileo's own time.</p>\n<p>One point I tried to make clear was that science was only then beginning to manifest itself as an independent discourse, that it was perfectly natural for the Church to be interested in science at the time and even claim authority on the matter. Of course, I'm no specialist on the matter, but it seems to me that this basic point is worth making. Most students seemed to get it too. Indeed, I felt like cheering when one woman near the end of a class wondered aloud what people would think about our own world in another few hundred years. Sound trivial? Maybe to historians and those for whom historical thinking comes naturally. In our presentist society and with this <a href=\"https://markstoneman.com/2007/07/21/across-generations/\">presentist generation</a>, I think the question was excellent. This student and her classmates were thinking historically.</p>\n\nThe success of this discussion was also due in part to another issue. I have begun to \"legitimate confusion\" for my students,[^1] that is, I have begun to cultivate an awareness in them of just how hard historical interpretation can be and how important learning how to ask questions can be. With this attitude, students can explore sources and ideas honestly and thoughtfully without fear of getting it wrong and looking bad.

				"content_text": "<p>It's spring break at <a href=\"http://www.gmu.edu\">George Mason University</a> (GMU), and, starting tomorrow, I will have the apartment to myself during the day. Of course, there is a mountain of student work to correct and classes to prepare, but I think I will be able to resume blogging here again. For starters, I do not have to spend three hours a day in busses and trains between Northwest DC and Fairfax, VA. Excuses aside, I sure do admire those of you who are able to teach and blog at the same time, and I hope to begin doing the same again myself. And, hey, I even have a TA this semester, though I don't really have an office, unless having a place available for office hours that three other people use counts.</p>\n\n<p>I'm teaching three sections of History 100 again, that is, GMU's one-semester survey in Western Civilization. I'm doing it differently <a href=\"http://historysurvey.blogspot.com/2007/12/getting-ready-for-spring-2008-hist-100.html\">this semester</a> than in previous semesters. I've thrown out the chronological approach in favor of a thematic one. I would have done this earlier, but I never got around to planning it out. This time I did not let a minor detail like that get in my way. Better to name six major themes ahead of time and then work my way through them during the semester. The chronological alternative was simply too frustrating for both me and my students.</p>\n\n<p>I've also dispensed with traditional exams and writing assignments. Instead they are each doing a Wikipedia project, an idea I got from <a href=\"http://edwired.org/?p=245\">Mills Kelly</a>. They are also doing a group research project (three to four students each) that will result in electronic output, whether a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dnL00TdmLY\">wiki</a>, a blog, an old-fashioned website, or something on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRqUE6IHTEA\">GoogleDocs</a>. Traditional writing and research skills still matter, but I thought I would give them assignments that teach other skills as well.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I've learned in the process already: I have to spend a lot of one-on-one time with individual students who are less familiar with this media. But they're catching on, and the course wiki I set up with Wikispaces is working well. Each page has a place for threaded discussions, and the students are talking. I'd like to think it was for the love of the subject, which in some cases it is. I am also basing a substantial chunk of their grades for the course on online and class participation.</p>\n\n<p>I do not think my thematic approach will have implications for my summer session at Georgetown University, where the mandatory survey, Themes in European Civilization, lasts two semesters. Also, because each course meets daily for five weeks in the summer, there will be no need for a wiki and there will be less opportunity for a long-term project. I'll probably work with the old format of exams and short papers, but I want to give that a little more thought.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>In his 1998 survey of human history, The Way of the World, David Fromkin writes of Prohibition in the United States thus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The experiment proved to be a disaster. Human nature resisted it. The inability of the government to enforce the laws against alcohol brought about a general collapse of law and order in such cities as Chicago in the 1920s. In the 1930s the law and the constitutional amendment were repealed, and order was restored. (215)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This observation reminds me of both drug policy and immigration policy in the United States.

				"content_text": "<p>Teaching undergraduate students forces me to deliver narratives and explanations to people who do not share my professional assumptions about how the world works and the way history should be told. It challenges me to think about how I can retell old stories with a different vocabulary. In the process I might even learn something. This is especially likely to happen when students ask me questions or express strong feelings about a major event. I last noticed this phenomenon in the fall, when I had my students visit the Holocaust Museum and discuss their experience in the course's online forum. I got to thinking about it again today because of an article about innovation in the New York Times last month. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/business/30know.html?ex=1356843600&en=5d04acf0f946a3a9&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink\">Innovative Minds Don't Think Alike</a>, by Janet Rae-Dupree, points to the benefits that can accrue to experts when they open themselves up to the perspectives of outsiders.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Rae-Dupree's article suggests to me other possible sources of historiographical innovation. What if we spent more time talking to historians doing research outside of our narrow areas of expertise? Such conversations should occur not only among historians with different regional specializations, but also among historians who study quite different things.</p>\n<p>This understanding of innovation also points to the intellectual bankruptcy of arguments some historians offer in condemnation of their colleagues' use of theoretical work from other disciplines. Drawing on the work of scholars in other fields can be highly productive. As a graduate student, I found the theoretical and empirical work of French sociologist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu\">Pierre Bourdieu</a> both stimulating and productive. I used it in my research, if not in my narratives, but I always used to wonder if historians' eclectic use of such work might lead to some rather unorthodox results that the original sociologist might reject. Nowadays I do not think any such rejection would bother me or undermine the value of the work I did. Maybe it takes an outsider to spark innovation in history, and maybe it also takes a historian to see a new way to use an outsider's ideas.</p>\n<p>This line of thought presupposes that innovation in history is a good thing, provided that it is true to the sources. Those who subscribe to the notion that history is only a recreation of the past as it actually was will probably object. I suspect, though, that while <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranke\">Leopold von Ranke's</a> view of history informs the working ethos of most of us historians, most of us are also more skeptical‚Äîand modest‚Äîabout our ability to recreate such a past, especially in view of our rapidly changing present, which affects how we see the past.</p>\n",

The first and second year students in my ‚ÄúModern Europe and U.S.,1815 to the Present‚Äù do not. This is not a failure on their part or mine.

But, as his campaign has gathered steam, he has found himself increasingly permitted inside the boundaries of respectable debate. He sat for an extensive interview with Tim Russert recently. He has raised almost $20 million in just three months, much of it online. And he received nearly three times as many votes as erstwhile front-runner Rudy Giuliani in last week's Iowa caucus. All the while he has generally been portrayed by the media as principled and serious, while garnering praise for being a \"straight-talker.\"\n\nThe truth about this man deserves the widest possible audience.\n\n<p class=\"callout\">See also <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080312091301/http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=74978161-f730-43a2-91c3-de262573a129\">Selections from Ron Paul's Newsletters</a>.

It's sleuth, Josef Maria Stachelmann, is a historian of the Third Reich. Wonderful read, if you know German. Anyway, my wife asked me about the Hossbach Protocol that Stachelmann is supposed to give a talk about. My memory failed me, so I took the easy way out with Google. Bad idea.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://markstoneman.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hossbachprotocol.jpg\"><img src=\"https://mrstoneman.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0cf24b6b37.jpg\" alt=\"HossbachProtocol\"/></a>\n\n<p>The first two hits on Google led to web sites that seek to appear legitimate, but which are in fact sites that deny the Holocaust and consider the Nuremberg Trial a travesty of justice. How did Google mess this up? Have some Nazi would-be academics learned <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization\">search engine optimization</a> (SEO)? Or was this blind luck? I'm not sure how Google's search engine works, but the results here certainly point to the limitations of algorithms that rely on the syntactic relevance of a site. Also, while no one is linking to the articles about the Hossbach Protocol directly, there are many links to the main sites on which the articles appear. (You can determine who is linking to a site by typing link:www.name-of-site.com into the Google search box, unless the site is using the nofollow attribute in its links.) In other words, the sites appear to be popular and therefore relevant in Google's eyes. In fact, Google has blessed both sites with respectable, if not overwhelming <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_rank\">page ranks</a> (PR). The first one <em>Historical Revisionism</em>, comes in at a PR 4, and the second one, <em>Institute for Historical Review</em>, at PR 5 on a scale of 0 to 10.</p>\n\n<p>Now I could stop with this warning about the limitations of Google search results, but perhaps there is more to be learned here. Perhaps I should also issue a plea to historians to both learn SEO and write for general audiences on the web. Like it or not, Google is the first place many people turn for answers, and anyone seeking one on the Hossbach Protocol can be easily led astray. Actually, historians might not even need to learn SEO. Wikipedia already has a high page rank and its pages turn up regularly at or near the top of Google search results. Perhaps all that is needed is more and better Wikipedia articles. The Hossbach Protocol doesn't show up in Wikipedia. If it had, the search results would have been different.</p>\n\n<p>Wikipedia brings up another twist. Typically, when one uses one term in Wikipedia that is more commonly known by another, Wikipedia will at least offer alternative results. (It's better than Google that way. Google can only offer spelling alternatives.) In this case, though, the more typical American name for this document did not show up in the search results. Only after I typed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hossbach_Memorandum\">Hossbach Memorandum</a> did I find what I was looking for. I then typed this term into Google and came up with much more satisfactory results. Only one of the right-wing links came up on the first page, and this time near the bottom.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://markstoneman.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hossbachmemorandum.jpg\"><img src=\"https://mrstoneman.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d3524b0f50.jpg\" alt=\"HossbachMemorandum\"/></a>\n\n<p>This final result brings me back to Wikipedia and SEO. We need to enter all possible variations of terms in Wikipedia articles so that they show up in search results. (Sure, I should have entered \"Hossbach Memorandum\" right from the start, but I translated directly and that was that. As the first set of search results shows, others have done so too.) We also need to do the same thing with web articles and blog posts. It won't do to leave the field open to the bad guys, simply because the world of SEO isn't part of our training and does not make or break historical careers. I don't know if <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Lipstadt\">Deborah Lipstadt</a> does any SEO, but her three-year-old <a href=\"http://lipstadt.blogspot.com/\">blog</a> combats holocaust denial and has a PR 6. More established historians need to follow her example in their respective fields.</p>\n",

This is especially the case if the major focus of their studies has been accuracy. They hesitate to say anything for fear of it getting it wrong. Such students need training in fluency. They need to practice talking and writing without stopping to correct themselves all the time. Yes, accuracy matters, but not at the cost of not being able to speak in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Students who have spent many years in the United States without formal training in English frequently experience the opposite problem. They can speak fluently, that is, they can say whatever is on their minds. But often they make mistakes. These mistakes probably did not matter at first, but the student finds that now they do, especially in a professional context. Such students need to study grammar and practice speaking and writing accurately.</p>\n<p>Balancing fluency and accuracy is a tricky business though. Students emphasizing fluency still need to keep grammar in mind, and students improving their accuracy dare not become so concerned about accuracy that they can no longer speak easily. The trick is to find a healthy balance, and that balance will be different for each student.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<img src=\"https://mrstoneman.micro.blog/uploads/2024/feeb5b97e2.jpg\" alt=\"'For Better or Worse' cartoon.

An organization of historians has no business claiming expertise in making war and peace. Instead I wish it would devote more attention to the study of war and society in the past.

				"content_text": "<p class=\"callout\">Originally posted on <em>Clio and Me</em> on this date.</p>\n\n<p>There has been much scrutiny in the press recently about the U.S. outsourcing military missions to private companies like Blackwater. P. W. Singer pointed out many <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/05/AR2007100501677.html?referrer=delicious\">problems</a> with this trend in yesterday's <em>Washington Post</em>. The most important from my point of view is the weak link between the American people and warmaking:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since the end of the Vietnam War, the United States has sought to ensure that there's a link between the public and the costs of war, so that good decisions will be made and an ethos of responsibility fostered. With about half our operation in Iraq in private hands, that link has been jeopardized.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps we live in a new world that I do not understand, but it seems to me that the past several hundred years of Western history have shown that a people at war can create a far more powerful political and military force than anything a cabinet can muster on its own. If the war in Iraq is so important, this country's citizens should be more directly involved, for they are the real basis of American power. But they are also a brake on the reckless use of military force. They will only mobilize for compelling reasons. One of President Bush's mistakes was to go to war with only enough public support to begin it. There is no such thing as war on the cheap. Private contractors are expensive in mere dollars, but they have helped the administration to avoid seeking a more solid domestic political foundation for the war‚Äîor accepting the consequences if it is unable to do so.</p>\n<p>Framing his piece as an open memorandum to the secretaries of defense and state, Singer devotes most of his attention to how counterproductive private military forces are on the ground. This line of thought is more likely to gain an audience than the more immediate focus in the media on the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/washington/02cnd-blackwater.html?ex=1349064000&en=2c3e29ccb2b2d94a&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink\">accountability</a> of men working for outfits like Blackwater. Yes, Congress needs to implement a legal framework for these men who stand outside both Iraqi law and the United States' own Uniform Code of Military Justice, but a strong concern for the rule of law and human rights has not been this administrations' strong suit.</p>\n<p>We also need to hear more about the organizational culture of Blackwater. Since it hires men with prior military experience, this requirement includes learning more about the military cultures whence they came, especially since Blackwater hires people of diverse national backgrounds, including people with experience in outfits with less than stellar human rights records. The question of military culture brings me back to the initial point about the weak link between the American people and the violence being done in its name in Iraq. The U.S. Army and Marines have their own organizational cultures, but these include a strong link to values in American civilian society. Can we say the same thing about our hired guns?</p>\n<p>Of course, the abuses at <a href=\"http://www.jurist.org/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C15%2C21%2C&search=%22Abu+Ghraib%22&limit=25&page=&author=&limit_by_date=true&date_range_start=2007-09-01&date_range_end=2007-10-08&filtered=true&narrow=&authored=false\">Abu Ghraib</a> show that our own military culture has some problems, though I suspect that the atrocities committed there had much to do with the inexperience of National Guard troops, a different culture in the CIA, the use of civilian defense contractors, and some troubling signals being sent from the highest levels of our civilian government, not to mention unclear lines of command and accountability.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p class=\"callout\">Georgetown University in Washington, DC, did not cancel classes on September 12th, so I went into a class packed with mainly freshman at 9:15 a.m. By that point teaching early modern European history was out of the question, so we talked. After I got home, I sent the following message to everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Date: Wednesday, September 12, 2001 12:56<br />Subject: reflections</p>\n<p>Hi everyone,</p>\n<p>Frankly, I was surprised by the rather large turnout in class this morning. Yesterday's news was disturbing, and many of us feel worse as the details and reality of the terrorist attacks sink in. The class discussion was heartening for me, because I saw a large group of curious, thinking, politically astute and morally aware students, who will one day help to lead this country. There is still much to learn (for your professors too), but your remarks show that you want to learn. This desire to learn about and engage in the world might help give a little meaning to the tragedy.</p>\n<p>Those of you who did not come to class leave me worried. Was it because of the general sad and bewildered atmosphere that has enveloped this city? Or have you lost family members or friends? I do not expect an answer to these questions, but I do want to point out two things to all students. First, those of you who feel despondent, in shock, depressed, angry, or confused should know that this is normal. You should also know that such feelings can be extremely debilitating if you cannot address them in some way. Make sure you seek out counselors, chaplains, advisors, professors, friends or family members for assistance. Some of you will find your academic work a good diversion--or way of understanding what happened. If, however, your personal situation makes such work impossible, because of depression or family obligations, please also visit your dean, who can run interference for you with your instructors.</p>\n<p>Student reactions in class covered a wide spectrum of opinion and emotions, which I would like to summarize. Some of you appeared numbed or angered by the attack and could not yet put it into some sort of abstract moral or political framework. Others were outraged at the apparent insensitivity some people showed towards this great loss. These are normal reactions, and I imagine most of you have felt or will feel similarly, at least for a time. Many of you pondered what the U.S. reaction should be. While some expressed concerns about the morality and justice of retribution, others worried about what application of force might actually work. Who was behind these atrocities and what would be the most efficacious manner of dealing with them? One of you pointed out that any political or military reactions must consider the mindset of the terrorists, their cultural assumptions and psychological make-up. We cannot assume that they think as we do. Some of you talked about what yesterday's event meant for your sense of security in the U.S. This concern appeared to waver between two poles: our own physical security and the impact that this violence will have on our own humanity. I underscored the latter concern. Finally, Anton [my TA that semester] pointed out that coming to terms with many of the big conflicts in our day entails learning how to ask the right questions. Besides learning about what happened in the past, our course provides an opportunity for you to learn how to ask trenchant questions.</p>\n<p>Finally, some personal notes: A friend of ours in Augsburg, Germany (north of Munich) called this morning to find out how we are doing. She says no one in Augsburg is talking about anything else. They are horrified. My mother-in-law in Munich spoke of a minute of silence being observed today in the textile industry (probably elsewhere too). As far as my friends in New York go, well, it is impossible to get through on the phone. One can only hope and, if one is so inclined, pray.</p>\n<p>I encourage you to participate in the university's various forums for dialog today, and to listen to or read some quality news, such as NPR radio, The Washington Post, and so on. Some of you might also read the foreign press online. Participating in the country's and world's dialog is good not only for your intellectual development, but also for your mental health.</p>\n<p>Take care of yourselves.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Mark Stoneman</p>\n<!-- This blog post originally appeared on my old history blog, Clio and Me, on this date. -->\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Historical scholarship can be as much the result of accident as planning. How on earth did I come to write a dissertation on Wilhelm Groener? I thought I liked doing social history, not biography. If I studied the army, I was more apt to find common soldiers interesting, not a general who assumed operational control of the whole army at the end of the First World War and who people addressed as \"Your Excellency.\" I was also not particularly interested in military-technical questions. Yes, I found the questions about humanity in warfare that I had explored in my M.A. thesis compelling. But German war planning for the First World War? And the German general staff's experience of the war? These were not my things either, or so I thought. Besides, were not many meters of library shelf-space filled with books on these problems?</p>\n\n<p>I first looked at Wilhelm Groener in a research seminar whose theme was the German bourgeoisie in Imperial Germany. Historians were devoting much renewed attention to this social class in the 1990s, because earlier interpretations had blamed the German middle class for not being middle-class enough and not doing what any bourgeoisie supposedly should have done, which was to put Prussia's powerful nobility in its place and establish a proper constitutional monarchy. Germany's unfortunate authoritarian modern history was attributed to an abstract process of maldevelopment, a German special path or <em>Sonderweg</em>, along which the bourgeoisie had failed to do what it allegedly had done in Britain and France, that is, rise up in a bourgeois revolution that made everything normal. New research on the middle class was beginning to undermine this view. Far from aping the nobility, the bourgeoisie had developed a self-confident, vibrant class culture. Our task in the seminar was to examine this research and consider its implications for understanding the broader outline‚Äîor grand narrative‚Äîof modern German history.</p>\n\n<p>I eventually decided to concentrate on the officer corps, because it played a key role in the narrative of German exceptionalism. The nobility had dominated the officer corps and made it an illiberal force in society more generally. According to this narrative, birth, not military know-how, had played a decisive role in military careers. Hence, not only had the military been illiberal, but its leaders had allegedly not kept up with the times. Parallel to this version of the officer corps, however, existed another in which the German general staff had been the preeminent professional military organization in the world. Which, if any, of these interpretations was right? Here was an opportunity to examine the military in a mainstream historiographical context. The German bourgeoisie was receiving a lot of attention in the historiography, but the military‚Äîso central to the German Sonderweg thesis‚Äîremained largely untouched by this research.</p>\n\n<p>So I did a comparative research paper on August Keim, Erich Ludendorff, and Wilhelm Groener, all commoners and all general staffers in Imperial Germany. I chose these men because there were enough published primary sources in Washington, DC to make a research paper viable. I showed that these men all had adhered to the mainstream bourgeois values that the new historiography identified, and I demonstrated that no contradiction between a military and a bourgeois ethos had existed. These commoners had not been \"feudalized\" by their aristocratic comrades-in-arms.</p>\n\n<p>Considering these issues without reference to the First World War was unthinkable, so I also explored Keim's, Ludendorff's, and Groener's images of war. After all, the feudal interpretation of the officer corps included a charge of aristocratic anachronism. Unfortunately, I was unable to link their social backgrounds and images of war, except to point out that their images of war comported with contemporary developments. Nonetheless, the work proved fruitful enough to suggest the possibility of a dissertation on one of these officers, Wilhelm Groener. I could use his biography as a vehicle for analyzing the sociology and culture of the Imperial German officer corps.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/166262/2024/e8936e0630.jpg\" alt=\"The back of the head of a Belgian Sheepdog is visible  as he walks down a dirt lane in the woods.

This association seeks recognition for the service of Cold War veterans and promotes the memory of what was in no small part their achievement. Still, veterans would do well to remember the strong connections between military and civilian life. U.S. armed forces did not simply protect the homeland. The Cold War was fought on the homefront too. And what about the relationship between the American homefront and U.S. military forces deployed around the world?</p>\n<p>I hope the museum also finds more room for critical analysis than the website currently evinces. While I understand the need for celebration, the Cold War Museum and the Cold War Veterans Association need to ask tougher questions, especially with regard to the Cold War's impact on the current state of our military and its relationship with civilian society. This is more than simply an academic question. Do not the men and women that our country places in harm's way deserve honest scholarship that can help the military to become an even more effective instrument of war and peace?</p>\n",

These are some of the questions that inform my interest in military history.\n\n---\n\nImages: [Cuirassiers in Berlin](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WWICuirassierBerlin.jpg) and [German war dead](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WorldWarIGermanDead.jpg), via Wikimedia Commons\n",
