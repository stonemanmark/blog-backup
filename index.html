			 <p>I really enjoyed Peter Pomerantsev, <em>This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War against Reality</em> (2019). He pursues his subject across much of the globe, seeking out people who have shaped fractured information spaces in pursuit of their activist or political consulting goals. And he historicizes the development of contemporary information wars and ideological confusion by relating these phenomena to developments during and since the late Cold War.</p>
<p>He lends coherence to the sprawling tale by jumping around places and phenomena in an impressionistic style, using his father&rsquo;s literary and radio biography as a reference point. The father was investigated by the KGB, which led to his family&rsquo;s exile from the Soviet Union. The son later worked in Russian television for nearly a decade, gaining an insider&rsquo;s view of Putin&rsquo;s Russia that turned out to be more broadly relevant than he had initially realized (Pomerantsev, <em>Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible</em> [2014]).</p>

			<h1><a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/08/21/workplace-safety-posters.html">Workplace Safety Posters, ca. 1936–40</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/08/21/workplace-safety-posters.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-08-21 22:05:54 -0400">Aug 21, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I am enjoying Depression-era workplace safety posters from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Works Progress Administration<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (WPA). They evoke a time when the power of government was effectively leveraged for good. If you live in the United States, there is a good chance you&rsquo;ve encountered WPA building and infrastructure projects. One WPA program was the Federal Arts Project, which put artists to work. To get a feel for the diversity of programs this art supported, see the Library of Congress&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->online collection<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Besides the four posters that follow this text, I include a photograph of an alley behind a row of houses with tiny back yards in Baltimore. If you look closely at this image from the Farm Security Administration, you can see a WPA poster attached to an open door in the bottom left-hand corner. It is captioned &ldquo;Stop accidents before they stop you.&rdquo; The building itself appears to be part of a factory of some kind because only a door and a single big wall with windows is visible, visually distinct from the opposite side of the alley, where all the little houses are.</p>
<p>These posters remind me of the ongoing importance of government for writing, publicizing, and enforcing workplace safety regulations. They connect past concerns about workplace conditions to countless reports of workplace injuries and sickness in our own time. They also link to family stories past and present, whether handed down or forgotten, whether taught or ignored in schools, workplaces, and union gatherings.</p>
<p>My grandmother&rsquo;s father was killed in an avoidable industrial accident in 1917 when she was six years old. The lathe he operated in a Cleveland factory had no safety guard, and then his luck ran out. He left behind six children and their mother, the oldest of them able to work. The sudden loss of this man represented a trauma that no one talked about in my childhood, and I only learned the barebones details from my mother this past year.</p>
<p>I often wonder if and how such trauma is passed down in other families, and why its causes are silenced or not. My mind goes there because I imagine that millions of Americans—from across the political spectrum—come from families with such experiences, even if these were not handed down from the past. And I wonder what, if anything, knowledge about these many pasts might do to change their attitudes today.</p>
<p>This thought ties in with the employers and politicians who fight government regulations and workers' collective bargaining. They strive to steal workers' freedom and dignity, all in the name of their own freedom. Part of this effort benefits from or fosters processes of families and communities forgetting or diminishing the significance of the workplace struggles and traumas in their own pasts.</p>
<p>Fortunately, good governance and organized labor seem to be making a comeback.</p>

			 <p>Michael Bohnert, an engineer at Rand Corporation, shares some useful insights about electronic warfare in the August 16, 2024 episode of the podcast <a href="https://shows.acast.com/ukraine-the-latest">Ukraine the Latest</a>. He discusses this topic in connection with Ukraine&rsquo;s Kursk incursion and describes the difficult choices that Russia&rsquo;s political and military leadership face in the coming months from the standpoint of electronic warfare.</p>
<p>Also, Anders Puck Nielsen, a military analyst in Denmark, released a helpful 15-minute video on YouTube today about where he thinks Russia&rsquo;s leadership is in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_80rUKItGc">responding to Ukraine&rsquo;s incursion</a>. Acknowledging complexity, he nonetheless keeps his viewers' eyes on two fundamental issues for Russia, namely, space and manpower, and he underlines the critical domestic political entanglements that the manpower question has.</p>
<p>Both of these contributions offer useful perspectives on Ukraine&rsquo;s shakeup of a common impression that the conflict was supposedly frozen. Of course, there are many more aspects of this story, but I highlight these contributions because I haven&rsquo;t seen them in other news stories so far.</p>

			 <p>In <em>This is Not Propaganda</em> (end of part 2), Peter Pomerantsev writes of his Russian family, based in Kyiv, becoming stateless in the late 1970s. The KGB had accused his father, Igor, of &ldquo;circulating defamatory fabrications, regular listening to hostile broadcasts and contacts with foreigners.&rdquo; They recommended he emigrate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In many ways Igor was lucky. He had the semblance of choice. The [KGB] major had made it clear that if he stayed, he would have the full seven years in prison and five exiled in the Soviet provinces to face. If he had been a Ukrainian-language poet, [Pomerantsev continues, Igor] would have been locked up immediately. Repression in Ukraine focused on exterminating any signs of independent Ukrainian culture outside the cultural crèche of state-sanctioned Soviet &lsquo;Ukrainianness&rsquo;. But Igor wrote in Russian, the language of the coloniser.</p>

			 <p>Lawrence O’Donnell had some tough words for his media colleagues yesterday on MSNBC. Journalists pretended to ask questions at a supposed news conference, broadcast live, while Trump pretended he was answering them. Throughout the charade, they gave him and his torrent of semi-coherent lies a pass, like they always do, most fatefully in 2016. Then O&rsquo;Donnell showed a longer segment by the one candidate who actually had something to say yesterday, but whose talk had not been deemed worthy of a live broadcast on any network: Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>The vice president spoke to the United Auto Workers in Detroit. Her message was not a simple repeat of her Philadelphia speech the day before. In this smaller, more focused setting, she talked about the importance of collective bargaining for achieving a fair result. What&rsquo;s more, she tied the term &ldquo;collective&rdquo; as used in an organized labour context to the community theme that figured so prominently in her Philadelphia speech. She linked the hard work of collective bargaining and of organizing politically to love of country, and she spoke of the dignity of labor.</p>
<p>Fairness and dignity. That&rsquo;s a message Americans need to hear about. What they got, instead, was an impotent rehash of the same old resentments, lies, and insecurities. I&rsquo;m not much for television news and opinion, but this 25-minute video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD-oTJ49nls">available on YouTube</a>) is important.

			 <p>There are two documentary films streaming on Paramount+ right now that I find inspiring and motivating: &ldquo;Superpower&rdquo; (2023), directed by Sean Penn and Aaron Kaufman; and &ldquo;Kiss the Future&rdquo; (2024), directed by Nenad Cicin-Sain. The first centers on Ukraine and Volodymyr Zelinsky in Russia&rsquo;s current war against Ukraine, and the second goes back to the Siege of Sarajevo (1992–96).</p>
<p>A theme common to each film is ordinary citizens standing up to genocidal aggressors. There is also the relationship between popular culture and politics in war, including the role of international celebrity. In the first movie, an entertainer-turned-president must lead a country in war, supported by a self-mobilizing citizenry. Moreover, one of the directors is himself an entertainer. In the second movie, inhabitants of a city under constant fire find a way to get by and even thrive with punk rock and dance. They are later joined on TV and then in person by the band U2.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Forms of Delirium&rdquo; is the third act of Peter Pomerantsev, <em>Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia</em> (New York: PublicAffairs, 2014). Now deep in the section titled &ldquo;A Brief History of Sects in Post-Soviet Russia,&rdquo; it dawns on me that this material provides useful context for the bizarre, messianic, wartime rhetoric I&rsquo;ve heard come out of Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov&rsquo;s mouth in the <a href="https://m.youtube.com/@russianmediamonitor" title="Russian Media Monitor on YouTube">television clips</a> that Julia Davis translates for English-speaking audiences.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Solovyov necessarily believes all the poison he spews. The first act of the same book, &ldquo;Reality Show Russia,&rdquo; provides plenty of background on that subject, even if it is based on prewar Russia. Still, the combination of mysticism, religion, ethnic Russian nationalism, and ostensibly anti-imperialist imperialism dripping from parts of the final act of this excellent book offers at least some reason for not dismissing a talking head like Solovyov out of hand. He may use the privilege of the fool to say extreme things, but he knows his words are landing.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m not the only one frustrated by the recent downtime on Micro.blog.  <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/07/10/im-frustrated-here.html">Anne Sturdivant</a> also expresses it, along with some other criticisms. I started responding on her post, but it got long enough I thought it would be more polite to post it here. Besides, this gives me a chance to try <a href="https://webmention.net">webmentions</a> on purpose for the first time.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/anniegreens">@anniegreens</a> The downtime also has me frustrated because there&rsquo;s been a lot of it, even if the overall average looks good. The other things that bother me are inconsistencies in features across the various user interfaces and out-of-date UI prompts and help docs. Still, I just migrated from WordPress, and I don&rsquo;t want to jump ship so quickly, especially since that comes with its own labor costs, especially for an amateur like myself. Besides, the price and the size of the small business make me fairly understanding, especially since they don&rsquo;t immediately blame user error, but not so much when it comes to the downtime.</p>
<p>The community stuff bothers me less because I didn&rsquo;t come to the platform for that, although <a href="https://micro.blog/help">@help</a> could do a better job of showing up on time in some of the help board queries. When they don&rsquo;t, I end up pestering that account and <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">Manton Reece</a> directly, unless I was lucky enough to get a helpful response. (Updating the help docs and UI tips might help here.)</p>
<p>As for the LLM stuff, <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> seems pretty clear-eyed about the limited cases it can be good for, and he&rsquo;s brought a Fediverse opt-in sensibility to its implementation here. Besides, it&rsquo;s hard for me to see how my fee is contributing to those services any more than my DuckDuckGo searches do. But yeah, every time I hear about a new software feature anywhere, my mind always goes to the question of needed fixes.</p>

			 <p>In a TAZ editorial, Carolina Schwarz observes a recent round of German organizations finally leaving Twitter. She argues that organizations who have been fighting to preserve the space that once was Twitter should <a href="https://taz.de/!6014969/" title="Deutsche Organisationen verlassen X: Haut endlich ab!">give it up</a>. Doing so will render it irrelevant.</p>
<p>I would add that public facing organizations and individuals need to get over their addiction to the misleading follower numbers on xitter (pronounce &ldquo;x&rdquo; with an &ldquo;sh&rdquo; sound) and learn how to navigate and help shape the open social media spaces in the Fediverse and the Fediverse-adjacent Bluesky. Public and publicly funded organizations in particular have a duty to make their communications accessible on open social platforms, even if they want to maintain a presence in the siloed spaces too.</p>
<p>In fact, I no longer bother following institutions, organizations, and publications not on an open social media platform or offering reliable RSS or JSON feeds. There&rsquo;s more than enough to learn in this world without relying on wealthy, would-be gatekeepers of content they did not create.</p>

			 <p>In Thursday&rsquo;s <em>Hareetz</em>, Ofer Aderet offers some <a href="https://archive.ph/gA8Rs">useful background</a> on the exemption of yeshiva students from military service. In 1948, there were only some 400 yeshiva students. Preserving their schools seemed a priority in the wake of the destruction of so much Jewish learning. The exemption was supposed to be temporary, but it still exists. Nowadays, there are more than 60,000 yeshiva students, and the religious and cultural situation of 1948 improved decades ago. Given Israel&rsquo;s current security situation, there is enormous societal pressure to make the burden of mandatory military service equitable. The current government, which includes ultra-Orthodox Jews, has avoided doing so, but the High Court of Justice ruled it has to. John Strawson talks about <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-will-israels-bombshell-court-ruling-that-haredi-jews-must-serve-in-the-military-mean-for-netanyahu-expert-qanda-233460">what this means for Netanyahu</a> in a question-and-answer piece in <em>The Conversation</em>. This second piece assumes less background knowledge on the part of the reader, while also going a bit deeper into the current political context.</p>
<p><em>Links to developments closer to home:</em> Conscription, what Americans call &ldquo;the draft,&rdquo; is a powerful tool for war, but it requires a broad political consensus about the justness of the war and a sense that conscription&rsquo;s implementation is fair. The U.S. Army and its political masters learned this lesson the hard way during the Vietnam War, after which the country moved to a volunteer force. By contrast, the Federal Republic of Germany held onto conscription until 2011 because its political leadership valued the link between military service and citizenship, a liberal tradition with roots in nineteenth-century political, military, and constitutional developments. Conscription is still in the country&rsquo;s Basic Law, but the number of people being called up made conscription inequitable and therefore untenable, at least during a time when a major war in Europe no longer seemed likely.</p>

<p>Air raids were a new danger in the Great War, and people within range of enemy aircraft needed to know what to do. The main caption of this related instructional poster reads, &ldquo;How should I behave during an air raid?&rdquo; Five captioned cartoons in the top row show what <em>not</em> to do. Below each of these is the recommended life-saving response.</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Get away from the window! Curiosity is death!&rdquo; The sketch shows a terror- or awe-stricken family looking out, many mouths wide open. Instead of gawking, the poster commands readers, &ldquo;Stand individually behind pillars!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Never remain standing on an exposed road!&rdquo; &ldquo;Always seek cover!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stand behind the door!&rdquo; This is followed by more advice about strong pillars or load-bearing sections of the wall.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Panic is worse than an air raid!&rdquo; Pictured are people hurrying down the stairs, one person holding a candle, another an oil lamp. Underfoot is a small child who has fallen down, and ahead of these residents is an old man with a cane, about to be trampled. Instead of panicking, the readers are told, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about an attack at night!&rdquo; Pictured is a man under a duvet sleeping soundly.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Never stand in the middle of the room!&rdquo; The picture below this final warning shows a domestic space in which a man in bare feet and a nightshirt has behaved correctly: He is standing in a corner, an empty bed nearby, but the middle of his floor has disappeared.</li>
</ol>
<p>The apparent repetition and contradiction in this anonymously produced poster suggest that the poster was less a product of foresight and more an ad hoc response to recent events or rumors.</p>

			 <p>I found a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020427061139/http://homepage.mac.com/markstoneman">2002 version</a> of my first website on the Wayback Machine. It&rsquo;s a copy they received from the web crawler Alexa Internet. (I don&rsquo;t think I even knew the Internet Archive existed back then.) I wrote the simple HTML, probably with BBEdit Lite, and posted it to the iDisk account I had with Apple. The interesting part about the site for me now is the collection of teaching links I placed on one page. Back then, however, I only indicated its presence with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070104222008/http://homepage.mac.com/markstoneman/links.html">links</a> in a small font size in the footer.</p>
<p>Soon after, I used Dreamweaver to create a more involved website, but not much of that effort has survived. Here&rsquo;s a welcome page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030803044644/http://homepage.mac.com/markstoneman/">from 2003</a> without the CSS and scripts. I didn&rsquo;t keep up the Dreamweaver approach because it was far too involved for my purposes.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080103033202/http://homepage.mac.com/markstoneman/index.html">By 2006</a>, at the latest, it seems I had learned to not use tables, but I have no idea why. After all, touch screen phones were not a thing yet.</p>
<p>Later the site evolved into a wiki, which I produced by simply exporting a VoodooPad wiki to a folder of HTML files using VoodooPad&rsquo;s built-in functionality. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080426211003/http://homepage.mac.com/markstoneman/">version from 2008</a>. Unfortunately, not all of it was archived, and I suspect not all of my VoodooPad files have survived either.</p>
<p>The previous 2008 link leads to a page that lists blogs I have long since <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2012/01/22/another-fresh-start.html">discontinued</a>. The stuff I did on Blogger was not crawled and archived (maybe because Google wasn&rsquo;t sharing its crawling the way Alexa did?). By contrast, some parts of my old WordPress and Tumblr sites seem to have been archived, though usually no more than a couple pages at a time. That said, I already integrated some of those posts into this iteration of my site.</p>
<p>When Apple announced it was closing down iDisk in 2012, I bought my domain and turned one of my WordPress blogs into my main home. Gone was my simple Wiki. VoodooPad never transitioned successfully to iOS anyway, and its new owner has had a hard time keeping up the pace of development. People complain about subscription models, but their absence can lead to the death of beloved apps.</p>
<p>My engagement on Twitter accompanied much of this activity. Some people gave up on blogging completely as a consequence of that platform. l&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Death, destruction, refugeehood, humanitarian crises – those are the things we&rsquo;re used to accepting as part of the reality of war&hellip; But in Gaza I also saw the death of the human soul. The Gazans are zombies. Death of souls on that scale, psychological wreckage at that level, I&rsquo;ve never seen anywhere. At a certain point, I went through Rafah, and the streets were filled with refugee tents, and people, and booths, and there were hardly any vehicles, because there&rsquo;s no fuel, so transportation is via carts and donkeys, and people move between them slowly. It took us two hours to cover a distance that normally would take 10 minutes. And all this time I looked at the faces of the people who were passing by us and I was shocked because they just looked dead.</p>

			 <p>The main reason I stuck with Bear.app for many years was the nesting tags feature. But Drafts.app has had that for some time too, so what is the point of Bear for me? The web content saving features aren&rsquo;t for me either because I&rsquo;ve got DEVONthink, which these days plays nicely on my iPad too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve postponed this decision several times because Bear is usually so reliable and easy, but no more. I could live with the recent unnecessary features it was cramming in, but the upgrade to Bear 2 or 2.2 seems to have made it susceptible to crashes. After experiencing that and an unpleasant support interaction, I had one foot out the door. Then I learned that the only regular backup option outside of the practical iCloud syncing was <em>manual</em>. And there was no versioning of individual notes. Both feet out the door now.</p>
<p>One very good thing about Bear is the ease with which one can move data in and out of it.</p>

<p>This is a fascinating short history that references the scholars whose work the cultural reporter draws on.</p>
<p>Teaser: &ldquo;Recent scholarship is uncovering the role of the women who ran libraries during the Harlem Renaissance where they built collections and, just as important, communities of writers and readers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agents of change: The necessary activism required of librarians in oppressive contexts will sound familiar to people today in the context of bans related to race and sexuality. For example, the only significant collection in the Jim Crow South was in Roanoke, Virginia. When the librarian there, Virginia Lee, was eventually told to get rid of the books, she moved them to the basement instead and continued to discretely circulate them.</p>
<p>Knowledge formation: The seemingly banal work of collection, classification, and organization required the creation of new knowledge. For instance, cataloging using the Dewey scheme required the addition of new subjects because that system only foresaw shelving Black-authored and Black-themed books in two limited spaces: under the headings of &ldquo;slavery&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Negro question,&rdquo; the latter a subset of &ldquo;colonization and migration.&rdquo; Dorothy Porter added entirely new categories, including for slave insurrections, the blues, and passing. She also reorganized American political history by situating presidents in topics important to Black readers. Andrew Johnson&rsquo;s tenure was filed under &ldquo;emancipation&rdquo; and Rutherford B. Hayes under &ldquo;Ku Klux Klan&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Knowledge, culture, and sociability: This article has some wonderful photographs, including of the women in groups.</p>
<p>Addendum: The New York Public Library and, within it, The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture have digitized some of their materials. That&rsquo;s where I found a powerful pastel by Morris Schulman titled <a href="https://historyofknowledge.net/2017/09/08/writing-lesson/">&ldquo;The Writing Lesson&rdquo;</a>.</p>

As far as I know, food as such is not in short supply in Russia. Was this the result of extreme mistreatment in one location? Or was it more widespread, systematic? Was it about torture with specific mission-related objectives? Was it zeal, resentment, sadism, corruption, indifference? Will this have any impact on Russian POWs in Ukraine?

<p>Anshel Pfeffer&rsquo;s analysis draws on the time-tested framework of civil-military relations. First and foremost, there is the conflict between the prime minister and his generals. Netanyahu is right to insist on the primacy of civilian political control of the army, but he has apparently never learned the value of taking counsel from his generals. Worse, he is resorting to using a stab-in-the-back conspiracy theory about the generals. People familiar with fascist takeovers will get very uncomfortable with this rhetoric.</p>
<p>Besides the conflict between the civilian and military leadership, there is the army itself, the IDF, whose ranks include conscripts and men and women called back because of their obligations in the reserves. There might be people who escape military service in Israel, but its army is more closely linked to civilian society than any in countries that use all-volunteer professional militaries. That places limits on how irresponsibly it can be used.</p>
<p>Then there is the mess of a war itself. Setting aside the humanitarian crisis and how the atrocities will scar the soldiers called to perpetrate them, there is the prime minister&rsquo;s narrow strategic vision. He and his government know how to order killing, but they have apparently forgotten how asymmetrical warfare works. That, or they think such conflict requires more blood&mdash;an attitude that fits very well with the aggrieved mentalities of stab-in-the-back &ldquo;victims&rdquo; (read: leaders in need of scapegoats to take the blame off themselves). In any case, Amos Harel&rsquo;s focus on certain military details&mdash;from the fighting in Gaza to the growing threat posed by Hezbollah in the north&mdash;reads well with the other article. Taken together, they show a fraught mess largely of Netanyahu&rsquo;s own making.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve started importing photos from my Instagram page to Pixelfed, a Fediverse alternative. The process is still ongoing, but the results look good so far. I skipped comments because moving those out of context doesn&rsquo;t feel right, but the text I originally included with the posts is still there.</p>
<p>I only began using this Instagram account in the pre-vaccination phase of the pandemic. It was after working with Levke Harders on her piece called <a href="https://historyofknowledge.net/2020/09/16/social-media/">&ldquo;Social Media as a Distinct Form of Knowledge Production,&quot;</a> in which she included some discussion about academic Instagram. I wanted to see what was even possible in that context. But it was hard to get into Instagram because of its excessive advertising, suggested posts I never asked for, and follow-spam from scammers. I&rsquo;ve also never loved the absence of an iPad app and third-party app alternatives. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind leaving the place entirely; however, as with Facebook, it&rsquo;s my only connection to some people, especially post-Twitter.</p>
<p>I still share a little there, but only if it&rsquo;s something specific I&rsquo;d like people there to see. Even then, <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/08/visited-facebook-last.html">Meta&rsquo;s algorithm might have other ideas</a>. Instagram makes sharing inconvenient, anyway. It wants you to post there first, whether with its app or its website. Sharing from there to other places is possible, but posting to there from other sources not, unless you&rsquo;re one of their business clients. (Facebook is handled a bit differently, but I&rsquo;ve given up trying to pay attention to Meta&rsquo;s latest gimmicks in human engineering.)</p>
<p>Pixelfed is nice. I&rsquo;m not sure how well it will work as social media for me because I haven&rsquo;t yet been social on it. In any case, it integrates well with Mastodon. I also wonder about the 4 GB storage limit on my instance, Pixelfed.de, but that has to be plenty for the time being. Besides, nothing is locked in the platform or in that instance of the platform. It&rsquo;s the independent web.</p>

<p>I still need to process this report, but its outline already lines up with the reporting presented in the prize-winning Frontline/AP documentary, &ldquo;20 Days in Mariupol&rdquo; (<a href="https://archive.org/details/youtube-gvAyykRvPBo">available in full on the Internet Archive</a>). Its chapters include:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Attacks on Objects Indispensable to the Survival (OIS) of the Civilian Population&rdquo;;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Denial of Humanitarian Aid&rdquo;;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Denial of Humanitarian Evacuations and Filtration&rdquo;; and</li>
<li>&ldquo;Arrest and Persecution of Humanitarian Volunteers.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>At the very least, Russia&rsquo;s systematic actions make one thing even more abundantly clear: Russia&rsquo;s invasion never had anything even remotely to do with &ldquo;protecting&rdquo; Russian speakers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also trying to grasp what Russia&rsquo;s actions mean to Ukrainians already keenly aware of Stalin&rsquo;s instrumentalization of hunger and famine against them.</p>
<p>Finally, it is interesting to see this report come out at a time when Israel&rsquo;s government has been deliberately starving Palestinians in Gaza. There are many past precedents for applying such methods in war, but the international humanitarian movement and international humanitarian law have been making significant strides. Public denials of starvation charges by perpetrators only underline their awareness of this reality.</p>

<p>The author, who has seen much as one of the founders of Human Rights Watch, has long been &ldquo;sparing&rdquo; in his application of the term &ldquo;genocide&rdquo; to state-committed atrocities over the past several decades. Initially he did not think of Israel&rsquo;s indiscriminate, even criminal violence against civilians as genocide, because Israel had a clear right to defend itself against the barbarous acts of Hamas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am now persuaded that Israel is engaged in genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. What has changed my mind is its sustained policy of obstructing the movement of humanitarian assistance into the territory.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What makes this specific article a good read is that he embeds his brief account of the current war into a broad framework of (1) violent conflicts outside of this one, (2) international discourses and agreements about humanity and law in war, and (3) the development of international humanitarian law. Of the last, he writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These efforts, which reflected the growing strength and capacity of the human rights movement, created public awareness of IHL and helped to establish the context in which a conflict such as the war in Gaza is being judged by concerned members of the public worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neier ends the piece with the establishment of courts to prosecute war crimes and crimes against international humanitarian law. He very briefly considers their relevance to the war in Gaza. Of course, Netanyahu cares little about international opinion or rules. The prime minister invokes &ldquo;antisemitism&rdquo; because it suits his current objectives.</p>
<p>Working against his methods is another fact that world leaders ignore at their own peril, it seems to me. As Neier writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been engaged in efforts to protect human rights for more than six decades, often in circumstances with exceedingly high stakes. I cannot recall any dispute over rights that aroused greater passions and more debate than that involving the war in Gaza since October 7.</p>

<p>Teaser: &ldquo;Last October, Palestinian students and academic staff in Israel faced unprecedented penalties for their speech. Now the repression persists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Takeaway: This piece shows just how far academic institutions in Israel have been willing to go in order to serve the state&rsquo;s goals at the expense of academic freedom, free speech, and the rule of law.</p>
<p>Question: How are universities governed in Israel? How vulnerable are they to outside political pressure under less fraught conditions? I am wondering about the political effects of Israel&rsquo;s extreme right-wing government, on one hand, and the broad effects of the current wartime climate, on the other.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The transition from Wordpress.com to Micro.blog was challenging because of the initial difficulty I had in finding and customizing a theme that worked for me. They either did not feel right to me, or I couldn&rsquo;t find sufficient documentation. This problem was multiplied by insufficient knowledge about Hugo (the blogging software) and Go (the language Hugo uses).</p>
<p>I initially passed over Tiny Theme because I did not appreciate its developer&rsquo;s approach, but pouring through the Micro.blog help forums led me to try it again. Armed with a little more knowledge, I began to appreciate what the theme offers.</p>
<p>Tiny Theme is the best-documented theme on Micro.blog. Besides the <a href="https://github.com/MattSLangford/Tiny-Theme-for-Micro.blog">Git page</a>, its creator, <a href="https://mattlangford.com">Matt Langford</a> has a dedicated <a href="https://tiny.micro.blog">Tiny Theme site</a>, written in plain language that assumes some knowledge of blogging and markup, but not overly much.</p>
<p>Matt also generously answers questions, but do your research first&mdash;both as a common courtesy and so you understand his answers.</p>
<p>I think his &ldquo;leave a tip link&rdquo; recalls the great tradition of shareware, which Apple&rsquo;s app store has undermined in the MacOS world. Why not honor his work and keep such a tradition alive at the same time?</p>
<h3 id="future-proofing">Future-Proofing</h3>
<p>The theme is built to be adaptable without changes requiring too many interventions in its core templates. One can still edit those, but Matt wrote the templates to look for a user&rsquo;s customizations in files called microhooks. This makes updating the theme much easier.</p>
<p>Update-proofing matters because Matt regularly maintains and updates the theme (in useful ways, not ways that require you to rethink everything).</p>
<p>In this respect, it is better to use your Micro.blog custom CSS page than to change the theme&rsquo;s CSS directly.</p>
<p>This last point about CSS is critical for making a move to another theme possible. A lot of CSS customizations are specific to a theme, but you have some that are not theme-specific, e.g., <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/12/small-image-galleries.html">small image galleries</a>.</p>
<p>If you customize one of the theme&rsquo;s core templates (as opposed to the microhooks you write from scratch), write down what you did. You will need this information later. See below for your own customizations.</p>
<h3 id="updating-tiny-theme">Updating Tiny Theme</h3>
<p>⚠️ When you see an update is available in Micro.blog&rsquo;s plugins UI (where the themes are stored), do not hit the update button. Instead, first go to Github to see which files have changed. (It&rsquo;s an easier UI for scanning modification dates.) Make a note of their names. Then hit the update button in the pugins UI.</p>
<p>⛔️ Never click the 🔄 button on the Micro.blog theme management page. Despite its emoji, it does <strong>not</strong> sync your files. It just downloads from the Github repository and overwrites your customized files, except the microhooks. You don&rsquo;t need this functionality,</p>
<p>After that, your theme files in Micro.blog&rsquo;s theme editing UI (menu item: Design) will all still be intact. Below that section are the unedited theme files. If you have modified any of the files that that were updated, see the next step. Otherwise you&rsquo;re done (except to eyeball your blog for any apparent issues).</p>
<p>Assuming you have taken notes on your modifications to any of the theme&rsquo;s templates that were updated, you first delete these modified files from the customization section, and then you modify and save the same changes in the section that holds the themes unmodified files. As soon as you do that, Micro.blog saves the file you your customized templates and restores the original template to the theme files section.</p>
<p>This setup relates to the lookup order of Micro.blog&rsquo;s Hugo rendering engine: It first looks if the necessary template is among the customized files. If it finds it, that&rsquo;s the one it uses to output that (part of the) page . If not, it looks to the original theme files. (If here either, it looks to Micro.blog&rsquo;s default files.)</p>
<h3 id="my-modifications">My Modifications</h3>
<p>This section does not include the microhooks, since the theme doesn&rsquo;t touch their contents.</p>
<h4 id="layouts_defaultlisthtml">layouts/_default/list.html</h4>
<p>This file renders category pages on . I merely added &ldquo;Category: &quot; before the page title (the category name) in the following block.</p>
<p><code>&lt;h2 class=&quot;p-name&quot;&gt;Category: {{ .Title }}&lt;/h2&gt;</code></p>
<h4 id="layouts_defaultlistarchivehtmlhtml">layouts/_default/list.archivehtml.html</h4>
<p>This is the template renders the archive page on Micro.blog, if you have enabled the page in Micro.blog&rsquo;s UI.</p>
<p>Main issues with Tiny Theme default:</p>
<ol>
<li>The categories are not alphabetized.</li>
<li>The categories render as a long vertical list.</li>
</ol>
<p>I needed alphabetical order and a format that worked better for all my categories than a vertical unordered list. (I have a lot of categories because Micro.blog is only set up for categories, not categories and tags.)</p>
<p>Tiny Theme has a microhook to add introductory material to the archive page, so that bit is not at issue here.</p>
<h5 id="original-section-section-of-this-theme-page">Original section section of this theme page:</h5>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;div class=&quot;archive-categories&quot;&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;Categories&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		{{ range $list }}
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{ .Permalink }}&quot;&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		{{ end }}
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ end }}
</code></pre><h5 id="modified-section">Modified section:</h5>
<p>I was able to get most of the following by copying and pasting from a file in the notes of a short YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un4vw1QscsY">video by Vlad Campos</a>. I fooled around a lot with it,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but I think I ended up just replacing the span tags with paragraph tags, which seems to have made CSS styling possible. (The indentation differences between this section and the original make no difference to Hugo, as far as I can tell.)</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;div class=&quot;archive-categories&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Categories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	{{ $sortedList := sort $list &quot;Title&quot; }}
	{{ $length := len $sortedList }}
    	{{ range $index, $element := $sortedList }}
        	 &lt;a href=&quot;{{ $element.Permalink }}&quot;&gt;{{ $element.Title }}&lt;/a&gt; {{ if lt $index (sub $length 1) }}{{ end }}
	        {{ end }} 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ end }}
</code></pre><section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I was fooling around with the sorting mechanism in the hope that I could retain a tags and categories distinction by prefacing each category name with an appropriate special character or emoji. When I did this, though, Hugo produced duplicates. I tried fixing that with the help of Hugo&rsquo;s documentation, but I never got anywhere.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <h3 id="my-history-with-wordpresscom">My history with WordPress.com</h3>
<ul>
<li>Began with free version, ca. 2007; was an improvement over Blogger (by then owned by Google).</li>
<li>Ads become too obtrusive, so paid to remove them.</li>
<li>Began using site not only to blog, but also as a professional signboard.</li>
<li>Eventually upgraded to business plan to meet customization needs (add plugins).
<ul>
<li>Made site usable for course materials (behind password) because setting up courses on Blackboard was crazy time-consuming, especially for an adjunct professor who couldn&rsquo;t get into any routine. (And Blackboard was unreliable.)</li>
<li>Continued to use site for blog and professional signboard. Expensive, but support always available via chat. Well worth it, especially now that I had a regular salary (editor, GHI).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Switch to freelance in 2020 required a whole new set up. I accomplished this by modifying one of their templates.</li>
<li>Within about 18 months, this site broke. WordPress.com declared the theme I was using deprecated &ndash; with no warning.</li>
<li>Started over, but stayed on WordPress.com because of my elder care responsibilities (my father&rsquo;s last several months alive).</li>
<li>WordPress.com all in on its block themed UI, so I  did it that way. Took a lot of extra work, and a new issue arose: page load times.
<ul>
<li>Search engine rankings were now taking these into account, and these block themes seemed to be monsters. Extensions needed to optimize images, CSS, scripts.</li>
<li>Cloudflare&rsquo;s Jetpack CDN was not all that fast. Needed to add Cloudflare to the mix for that and more control over caching.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Such a setup required constant attention, and WordPress.com&rsquo;s online customer support degraded: longer wait times, maybe no chat at all, longer email response times, if such were needed, and so on. To add insult to injury, they started selling expensive website optimization add-ons for problems they themselves were creating.</li>
<li>Before I let the site renew, I looked for a system that produced static pages because they load faster than a dynamic platform like WordPress, which builds pages on the fly.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be possible to render static pages on my own computer with Hugo (or related) and  then host these pages on Github or Cloudflare. Assuming modest traffic, this might even be free. But the learning curve. Hugo is powerful, but it&rsquo;s command-line only. I didn&rsquo;t have time before my other set-up had expired. Command line is doable for simpler tasks, but I&rsquo;ve found that tools like these are generally written for others already at home in this environment. The documentation tends to have a high bar of entry.</p>
<h3 id="choosing-microblog">Choosing Micro.blog</h3>
<ul>
<li>Micro.blog, which uses the Hugo engine, started to look attractive. Its web UI is quirky; its documentation is incomplete; and its Mac and iOS apps don&rsquo;t offer feature parity. Its underlying ethos, however, works for me: It wants average users to be able to work with its tools. At the same time, it offers ways to customize things, even if these options tend to presuppose a lot more prior knowledge.</li>
<li>Micro.blog is definitely not as easy as Blogger and WordPress were in the aughts, if you need to customize things. Once you get things running, though, you can write in Markdown, which humans can easily write and read. It&rsquo;s easy to post from any computer or mobile device, including my phone. (WordPress had made thar increasingly difficult.)</li>
<li>Micro.blog has its own social network, which I was not interested in, especially not in the wake of Twitter&rsquo;s murder and the ensuing platform fatigue (and I had come to Twitter after another platform imploded). But Micro.blog&rsquo;s network and the blogs it hosts are built so one can participate in the IndieWeb. One can pull one&rsquo;s content from elsewhere, syndicate the content of one&rsquo;s hosted blog, and so on. Even some replies can travel beyond a single platform or website.</li>
<li>There has been a learning curve for me, but it has solved not only my blog-hosting problem, but also offered me additional <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2023/09/19/juggling-social-media.html%20title=%22Juggling%20Social%20Media%20Platforms%22">options in this post-twitter world</a>.</li>
<li>Given the Fediverse context (which decentralizes comment moderation and involves many more people in the process, in relative terms), I&rsquo;ve even felt able to <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/03/comments-back-on.html">turn comments back on</a></li>
<li>And I&rsquo;ve seen the point of bringing back a <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/02/bringing-back-a.html">blogroll</a>.</li>
<li>Bonus point: there hasn&rsquo;t been any need to set up GDPR cookie notices, which were very necessary on WordPress.com (a self-hosted WordPress blog can be privacy friendlier, provided ). I still need a <a href="https://markstoneman.com/privacy-notice/">privacy notice</a>, but it&rsquo;s much simpler now, especially since I also removed YouTube embeds.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>As of today, MacStories is disallowing all known AI crawlers, including ChatGPT and Applebot. If you want to read our site, you should use a web browser or RSS.<br>
✌️<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/112609519691842609">Federico Viticci, June 13, 2023</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pronouncement could, indeed, <em>is</em> being made by countless others who run independent websites. Questions and anxiety abound, but we are nowhere close to fashioning responses adequate to the current moment. A visceral sense of violation, of wrong, is hitting many of us, who have long since had enough of Silicon Valley, Madison Avenue, and all the rest treating the traces we leave online as a natural resource to extract value from. Yesterday, the above-quoted observer on Mastodon <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/112606317077490324#">reported</a>, &ldquo;I was grossed out when I read that Applebot scraped &lsquo;the open web&rsquo; to train their AI model&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>My most immediate question about his no-AIs-on-MacStories statement was <em>how?</em> How you are working to keep <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLMs</a> from feasting on your site? Take the robots.txt file: Are there settings that allow search engines to index pages while instructing those same search engines that their LLM activities are not welcome? How do you cover all known LLMs and related scraping activities in a meaningful way? Aren&rsquo;t these things and their user numbers multiplying and mutating in ways that exceed our individual tracking abilities, not to mention <a href="https://www.searchenginecodex.com/proposing-a-new-meta-tag-for-llm-ai/" title="Dena Mason, 'Proposing A New Meta Tag For LLM/AI'">the limits</a> of what a robots.txt file can hold?</p>
<p>Alternatively, have you found a way to make copyright and licensing statements that these tools will understand and honor? I&rsquo;m trying meta tags, but I think only the first of the two below is standard:</p>
<p><code>&lt;meta name=&quot;author&quot; content=&quot;Mark R. Stoneman&quot;&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;meta name=&quot;license&quot; content=&quot;CC BY-NC-SA 4.0&quot;&gt;</code></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also using semantic tags to ensure my copyright and CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license statements in the footer are easily discoverable, but it all feels so provisional, so early-2000s-wild-west again. Only worse.</p>
<p>Moreover, the LLM challenge reaches beyond simple illegal copying, downloading, storage, and retrieval. These LLMs are being trained on our words, trained, it almost seems, by lurking in our conversations and learning. Their value proposition is that they will build something new on the basis of what already exists. Although this feels purely extractive (like Elsevier&rsquo;s contribution to academic publishing), how can such direct links between our individual output and that of the LLMs be established?</p>
<p>Perhaps we are mixing feelings and concepts in ways that do not necessarily apply to the current situation. To begin with, there is that sense of personal violation that many of us have long felt with respect to the trackers that Google and other marketing entities use without our permission. The European Union&rsquo;s <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">GDPR</a> is meant to address that problem for its citizenry, but the phenomenon of LLMs training on our language does not necessarily amount to an infringement of our data privacy&mdash;not if they are &ldquo;learning&rdquo; how to &ldquo;listen&rdquo; and &ldquo;talk&rdquo;, but not retaining data on our personal habits for later use. At the same time, this LLM scraping feels even creepier and more extractive than what advertising trackers were doing in the pre&ndash;LLM era.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to imagine how we can regain a sense of control over the things we publish on the internet. We need practical web standards and tools that give us choices that the big LLM players are willing to respect. We need metaphors that reach beyond copyright and privacy, when necessary, but that don&rsquo;t lead us to anthropomorphize the LLMs and their &ldquo;learning&rdquo;, thereby making the problem of so-called AI even worse. And we need jurisprudence that looks for ways to deal with our sense of violation that privacy laws and copyright alone do not seem adequate for. Meanwhile companies that use our linguistic existences to sell language-based LLM services back to us would do well to listen to their critics and adjust their activities accordingly. Wrapping up everything in pretty privacy policies and new feature hype will not be enough for them to thrive, although their deep pockets will help buy the legal frameworks they want, if we&rsquo;re not paying attention.</p>

<h3 id="html-example-for-two-columns">HTML Example for Two Columns</h3>
<ul>
<li>Works well landscape-oriented images. Example from <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2023/08/25/sign-of-life.html">Aug. 25, 2023</a>, but is also serviceable for vertical images, e.g. this <a href="https://markstoneman.com//2023/01/01/peace-and-war.html">Jan. 1, 2023</a> post.</li>
<li>After you are done with the following, link the images to their full size counterpart. This is very easy in MarsEdit.</li>
<li>You can replace images in one div with <code>&lt;p&gt;text&lt;/p&gt;</code>, if you want. Example post from <a href="https://markstoneman.com//2023/09/01/more-time-in.html">Sept. 1, 2023</a>. But if you put text in both columns, you’ll need to fiddle with the padding, as I did inline on <a href="https://markstoneman.com//2024/06/12/fediverseconnected-accounts.html">June 12, 2024</a> with my eyes on both the desktop and my phone.</li>

			 <p><em>New post format: notes written only for myself, but perhaps of interest to others.  Will file under a new <a href="markstoneman.com/categories/notes">notes</a> category for now, while also using the blog&rsquo;s other relevant categories.</em></p>
<p>I ran into the term &ldquo;digital gardens&rdquo; on the 🦣  profile of <a href="https://pkm.social/@RDK">@RDK@pkm.social</a>, which I looked up because of a repost by <a href="https://indieapps.space/@drafts">@drafts@indieapps.space</a> of a piece on the latter&rsquo;s search functionality. RDK&rsquo;s whole website, <a href="https://justtext.net/">Just Text</a>, has a quirky feel that reminds me of some Micro.blog-hosted blogs. These have extra pages about stuff that matters to them, lists, photos, a Tweet archive, other collections of related content.</p>
<p>I did a web search and started with <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/">&ldquo;Digital gardens let you cultivate your own little bit of the internet&rdquo;</a> (short). And then <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">&ldquo;A Brief History &amp; Ethos of the Digital Garden -&quot;</a>(detailed, thoughtful) by Maggie Appleton. The approach draws a contrast to (micro)blogging, and in some cases might take the form of a wiki, as in <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/">Tom Critchlow. Move. Think. Create.</a></p>
<p>This last one reminds me of my early course websites and source reference pages. At some point in the early aughts, I produced everything on VoodooPad (MacOS) and simply exported it into static html files. These I uploaded to whatever cloud-sharing service Apple offered its users before iCloud. The personal wikis also make me think about readings I did later for an unfinished project,
<a href="https://markstoneman.com/2017/06/23/war-gender-and.html">&ldquo;War, Gender, and Nation in 19th-Century Europe&rdquo;</a>. All my notes were in an iOS wiki made with an app that is no longer available. I hope my export of that file survived my various digital moves since then.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there has to be a dichotomy between timelines and other forms of independent webby existence.  I believe in my war and gender project, I not only interlinked reading notes and topic pages but also a research journal. I need that chronology too because I learn that way. This last point became clear again this past month while moving web hosts and redoing my categories. Revisiting the old has me making connections and gaining insights.</p>
<p>But I also need communication, and I like the Indie Web&rsquo;s general outlook on that. References: indieweb.org, book.micro.blog.</p>
<p>A common theme in these various approaches to the web seems to be <em>intentionality</em>. Many of us practiced more of that in 2020–2021, during the worst of the pandemic. I find myself in need of that now, too, because of the major disruptions that continue to affect my life.</p>
<p>Possibly related: yesterday I was thinking that my <a href="https://markstoneman.com/portfolio/">portfolio</a>, organized for others, could also be accessed through short, related blog posts. Maybe the bridge could be this notes format.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t cross-post notes pages to any social accounts, unless one is relevant to a particular discussion.</p>
<p>Addition: I just ran across the website of Sarah Shotts via a query on Micro.blog&rsquo;s forum. Their <a href="https://www.sarahshotts.com/log">Artist&rsquo;s Log</a> page is subtitled &ldquo;A Commonplace Book and Curiosity Cabinet of My Creative Ecosystem.&rdquo; What a wonderful way to put it. This log is a menu item on a site that presents the artist&rsquo;s portfolio, books, and bio to the world.</p>

<p>Von Schock und Überraschung nach den gestrigen Wahlergebnissen lese ich auf Mastodon. Wirklich aber? Es gab ja in Deutschland das Ganze mit dem Kampf gegen die nötige Machtausübung des Staates während der schlimmsten Momente der Pandemie. Mangelndes Mitgefühl hat das schon gezeigt, und grosse Vertrauensverlust den Machtausübenden gegenüber. Vielleicht triftiger noch: wir in den USA kennen eine starke Affinität zwischen solchen Ansichten und rechtspopulistischem bzw. rechtsradikalem Gedankengut. Ich meine, daß diesen Zusammenhang öfters in Deutschland auch konstatiert wurde.</p>
<p>Ich denke auch etwa an 2015 und an &ndash; anders aber relevant &ndash; die schlimmen Angriffe auf ausländische Mitbürger kurz nach der Wende. Neuerdings gab us wieder das instinktive Weiterrücken der CDU/CSU Führung nach rechts, was ja nicht im Vakuum geschieht. Zu guter Letzt gibt es die Rückgratlosigkeit des Bundeskanzlers und einer Großzahl anderer Politiker, die die öffentliche Meinung lieber folgen als lenken zu versuchen. Mich sollte es eher überraschen, daß es Überraschung gibt, aber das kenn ich in den USA auch, wie viel vom vorher Erwähntem auch.</p>
<p>Es gibt zwei berühmten schwarzen Komiker hierzulande, die in einem Sketch nach der Wahl 2016 nur lachen konnten, weil sie sehr wohl wußten, dass der Rassismus weiterhin fluorierte. Wenn man Peacock in den USA hat, ist es wohl leicht zu finden. Sonst fällt mir leider nur <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHG0ezLiVGc" title="All (Vanessa Bayer, Aidy Bryant, Beck Bennett, Cecily Strong) but two friends (Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock) are surprised by Donald Trump's victory while watching the election results roll in.">YouTube</a> ein.</p>

			 <p>Max Boot on Threads <a href="https://www.threads.net/@maxboot/post/C762T_5uH_c">writes</a>, &ldquo;I really want Threads to take over from X which is broken. But this is discouraging.&rdquo; Setting aside the fact that he has 23,000 followers, I typed a hurried response because I just can&rsquo;t hear it anymore. Why do so many smart, media-savvy people refuse to understand what has happened in the social media space over the past two years? Maybe it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ve always understood Twitter as just another broadcast medium?</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mark.stoneman/post/C7-k8KJOac2">my reply</a> as is, warts and all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe people accustomed to huge followings need to rethink how they do social media. The days of one platform are gone. A lot of us you will want to reach will never be reachable on twitter. And many of us will not stay on threads if it does not actually federate or stop playing around with its algorithm in such an unhelpful way. Try Bluesky, and try encouraging people to set up algorithms that will discover news. Try setting up such algorithms yourself and spreading the word about them. 1/2</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Use tools that let you broadcast to multiple platforms. But also, stop thinking of such media as broadcast media. Go for quality interactions too. Doing so can have its own network effects. Besides, shouldn&rsquo;t your media organizations be setting up tools too, such as their own Mastodon instances, Bluesky algorithms for your benefit, etc. There will never again be a pre-Musk Twitter. And we need to stop relying on the mega rich to build our tools. 2/2</p>

			 <p>The IndieWeb approach is about owning your own content. Making over one&rsquo;s web presence in such terms might also be about fashioning a whole self in the face of the fracturing that corporate siloes and algorithms incentivize and create.

			 <p>I am wondering how Threads can really federate given what Meta is doing with user content and so-called AI. There&rsquo;s opt-out in Europe and no choice whatsoever in the United States. While both situations are bad, they are becoming known. But what about people on other Fediverse instances who casually interact with a Threads account? I wonder who&rsquo;s working harder right now to achieve federation, Threads' coders, their legal team, or their spin doctors? The doublespeak, selective listening, and tone-deafness in Adam Mosseri&rsquo;s posts are sometimes hard to overlook.</p>

			 <p>I just noticed that the <a href="/portfolio/history-of-knowledge-blogs/">History of Knowledge</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;About&rdquo; page has been rewritten to claim that the GHI&rsquo;s director conceived that project. I would tell the story somewhat differently, but the boss gets to tell the story the way she wants.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Besides, this version reinforces my impression that my co-editor and I did something good because this boss would never claim ownership of a dud.</p>
<p>In fact, the site is still thriving, and, remarkably, it&rsquo;s chugging along with the same old Penscratch theme from WordPress&rsquo;s pre&ndash;block theme era. In an academic culture focused on making the new, while ignoring the need to maintain what has already been built, this is also a win of sorts. And I rest easier knowing that the site is being regularly archived by the Wayback Machine. Regardless of a director&rsquo;s priorities and the institute&rsquo;s funding, this thing will continue to exist for quite a while.</p>
<p>I just wish the current team had a more modern understanding of social media. Staying on Twitter after 2022 has meant relegating any conversation with readers and contributors to a now siloed platform that countless scholars and concerned citizens have abandoned. Of course, this criticism presupposes a desire for conversation. I suspect, though, that social media is purely a broadcast medium for the current team, as it is for many organizations. After all, engagement takes time, which means financial and opportunity costs.</p>

But time will tell. Right now, I can unmark a problematic comment so it doesn&rsquo;t appear, but only after the comment is initially posted. (The developer behind Micro.blog is considering making prior-approval an option.) I also have the usual mute, block, and report options.</p>
<p>Next step: seeing what happens&mdash;and what I might still need to do&mdash;if I get any responses from other sites via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention">webmention</a>. I&rsquo;m definitely enjoying what the IndieWeb community makes possible, but I wish its tools and documentation were more accessible to non-programming folk. I can deal with modern HTML and CSS, but that&rsquo;s as far as it goes.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since I maintained a blogroll, but the poisoning of Twitter makes me think it&rsquo;s a good idea. I do not want my network to be owned by a random billionaire whose interests are at odds with community building and maintenance. I&rsquo;ve been slowly (re)connecting with people on other microblogging platforms, but it&rsquo;s time to begin making my own site social as well. That&rsquo;s why the <a href="/blogroll">blogroll</a> is back.</p>
<p>A couple first impressions: I&rsquo;m noticing fewer blogs among people I&rsquo;m following on Mastodon than I would have expected on Twitter some fifteen years ago, when microblogging was not yet so ubiquitous. There are plenty of websites as CVs and marketing tools (for books and speaking engagements), but not as many blogs per se. On the other hand, there is a ton of microblogging going on. It&rsquo;s possible that some of these accounts should find their way onto my blogroll&mdash;perhaps more personal blogs too. But baby steps.</p>
<p>For now, I want to curate a list that reflects the interests on display in my own blogging. This approach will not necessarily create social connections with those I list, but it should manifest socially contingent knowledge about other blogs that some readers might find useful. In other words, I&rsquo;m trying to offer some social or human-driven discovery as opposed to the stuff that algorithmically driven search engines and social media deliver.</p>

			 <p>I quit the old bird site <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2022/12/04/bye-bye-birdie/" title="Bye Bye Birdie">last December</a>, and I&rsquo;ve been a happy <a href="https://zirk.us/@markstoneman">Mastodon</a> user instead ever since. Nonetheless, I&rsquo;ve recently begun dalliances with <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mark.stoneman">Threads</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/markstoneman.com">Bluesky</a>. I&rsquo;m not looking for greener pastures, but I&rsquo;m curious about what&rsquo;s on offer now, and I want to find some of the people who I don&rsquo;t see on Mastodon. Juggling social media platforms is inconvenient, but seemingly unavoidable at this particular moment, as people search for new communities and rebuild parts of their old ones. It is a moment of flux, and such flux could very well be the new normal.</p>
<h3 id="the-twitter-that-was">The Twitter that Was</h3>
<p>Among the growing circles of people who have quit the place once called Twitter, discussions about the new platforms tend to occur in reference to the old place, if only implicitly. But characterizing that old place is not as straightforward as one might think. Before the recent ill-considered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/07/musk-rushes-out-new-twitter-logo-its-just-an-x-that-someone-tweeted-at-him/" title="Musk rushes out new Twitter logo—it’s just an X that someone tweeted at him">rebranding</a> to X, Twitter was already different things to different people, depending not only on individual preferences but also on Twitter&rsquo;s possibilities. Those changed a great deal over the platform&rsquo;s first fifteen years, evolving in a synergy between users and developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag">Hashtags</a> were first employed by users as a way to organize and find posts. They also became tools for community-building. (Katrina Gulliver started using #twitterstorians back when historians' numbers there were relatively modest, for example, and this enabled us to find each other.) Quote tweets arose from user efforts to editorialize about others' posts. And threads, multipart tweets known earlier as tweetstorms, helped make such bursts of text easier to read in the order intended by the author. As Twitter adopted or initiated such features, they assumed different roles in users' practices and expectations, depending not only on users' needs and preferences but also on when they first adopted Twitter.</p>
<p>In the early days, independent developers improved the Twitter experience with third-party mobile and desktop applications that offered features Twitter did not, or they implemented functionalities differently. It was also possible to follow what was happening by using an older internet protocol called RSS, the same thing one can still use to follow blogs and other sites in a newsreader (I use <a href="https://netnewswire.com" title="A free open-source Mac and iOS app">NetNewsWire</a>). And services emerged to let one stitch a series of posts into a single story. Blogging and other content management systems worked out ways to integrate users' activities with Twitter, and automation services such as IFTTT and Zapier made it possible to set up recipes that were triggered in the event of certain content. One could use a specific hashtag in a tweet, and that hashtag would trigger an IFTTT recipe to post the same thing on Facebook. There were also bots, little applications that could pull data from somewhere, including Twitter, and post to Twitter themselves, acting openly as bots or masquerading as real people. Coders created bots for fun and bots for good, but also bots that served grifters and the spread of disinformation.</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s open <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a> made this diverse range of activity and user experiences possible. Its now prohibitively priced API has meant the death of most third-party applications and services.</p>
<p>As people leave xitter, they are searching for different things and reacting to other platforms accordingly. They are first and foremost looking for people from their old network. But they are also looking for specific features, the kind that can help them to approximate their earlier experiences, or even improve on them.</p>
<h3 id="the-apps-i-use">The Apps I Use</h3>
<p>In my case, a crucial aspect of the features question is how well each platform dovetails with my established routines on the iPad and Mac. Specifically, I am interested in integration with third-party apps and services for composition, crossposting, and syndication. I also want good apps for the specific social media platforms I&rsquo;m on. And I want a choice in the matter, like I used to have with Twitter before Musk started to reshape his newly purchased realm into a walled-off dystopia.</p>
<p>I have come to like Mastodon so much in part because <a href="https://tapbots.com">Tapbots</a> was so fast to release and refine a Mastodon client called <strong>Ivory</strong> (iOS and Mac). Having used this small company’s excellent <a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> for at least a decade, I felt at home in Ivory right away, much more so than in the other Mastodon apps I tried.</p>
<p>Another helpful app that I have used for many years is <strong>Linky</strong> by <a href="https://pragmaticcode.com">Pragmatic Code</a>. An iOS app that is available through the system&rsquo;s share extension from within Safari, it lets me post a link and select the accompanying image or images I want. Adding <a href="https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/describe-content-images">alt text</a> to each image for those who use a <a href="https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-products/screen-readers">screen reader</a> is also easy. So is creating an image from selected text (a text shot) with the same text added automatically to the alt text. Linky works with other browsers too, but not for text shot creation.</p>
<p>In the old days, before Facebook sealed its platform off from third-party clients, I could post to the bird and face sites at the same time with Linky. Nowadays, we&rsquo;re down to Mastodon, although a beta release this month has added <a href="https://mastodon.social/@pragmaticcode/111001659389734215">support for Bluesky</a>. Threads support is currently not on the table because there is no public API for developers to work with.</p>
<p>Another iOS and Mac app that I have long used with social media is <strong><a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a></strong> by Agile Tortoise. Besides being a really good input device that makes working with text a breeze on a mobile device, it has all manner of actions to automate moving one&rsquo;s text to other apps. Using the system share menu, it is possible to move text anywhere, but its ability to post directly to a platform is currently limited to Mastodon.</p>
<p>I use three Mastodon actions in Drafts: one to post directly, one to post a thread of multiple numbered posts with a single click, and one that opens the post in an Ivory draft (handy for adding images and accompanying alt text). There are many more actions available, too, because Drafts has an active userbase that contributes to the actions in its <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com" title="Drafts Directory">directory</a>. In fact, if you know how to write scripts, you could probably create an action that posts directly to Bluesky because that platform, like Mastodon, is open-source, albeit with a different, less mature internet protocol.</p>
<h3 id="diversity-of-platforms">Diversity of Platforms</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s still early days in this post-xitter world, so I&rsquo;ll talk about the kinds of people I&rsquo;m finding and interactions I&rsquo;m having another time. Only one thing is already clear: Many of the academics I used to follow are happy with Mastodon, but they don&rsquo;t necessarily use the same tools I do. Many others are still hopping about, trying the different places, and sometimes even keeping xitter in the mix. Based on the behavior and comments I&rsquo;m seeing, I suspect there will no longer be a single, one-size-fits-all-in-countless-different-ways platform of the kind the old bird place had become. I&rsquo;m resigned to using more than one social media venue, as different people find the social media platforms that suit them best.</p>
<p>Besides, there must be people out there working on ways to read and post on multiple platforms from within the same application. It&rsquo;s too bad some social networking platforms will remain closed to such efforts, but I hope openness and some amount of interoperability is where the winds are blowing, at least outside of xitter. If Threads adds support for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23689570/activitypub-protocol-standard-social-network">ActivityPub</a> (the protocol that Mastodon uses), as Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/introducing-threads-new-app-text-sharing/">announced</a> it would, that would send a powerful signal to commercial social networks, despite Meta&rsquo;s record of locking people inside Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>Openness and interoperability ought to be goals we can agree on. Imagine if your email provider didn&rsquo;t let you communicate with people outside their service. Imagine them holding your contacts hostage if you changed services. What about not being able to choose how you read your email, that is, with which app or web interface? Avoiding that kind of nonsense is a major promise of Mastodon and the other kinds of software that use ActivityPub.</p>

Chocorua was front and center, and Washington rose up behind it in a pairing that is impossible to imagine in Chocorua&rsquo;s shadow, where I grew up, let alone in Mt.

			 <p>In the past, I rarely watched YouTube, but the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bird site&rsquo;s corruption<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has seen me on YouTube much more often, as I search for content about Ukraine.

There are 10 episodes, not counting a 3-minute trailer. All but the last are about 15 minutes long, and the final one is 25 minutes. (I&rsquo;ve seen half of them so far.) The series is largely in Ukrainian with English subtitles, and partly in English with Ukrainian subtitles, depending on who is speaking. The titles on YouTube are in Ukrainian, but there&rsquo;s a playlist that has them all in the correct order. Besides, you don&rsquo;t need to know the Cyrillic alphabet to read the episode numbers (єпізод 1, 2, 3 …) of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Media at War&rdquo; (Медіа на війні)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and to watch Ukrainians speak for themselves.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>My last post was of snow and now August is almost over? Yikes!</p>
<p>After commuting thousands of miles between DC and New Hampshire since my <a href="%5Bmarkstoneman.com/2022/07/1...%5D(https://markstoneman.com/2022/07/15/to-everything-there-is-a-season/)" title="To Everything There Is a Season">father&rsquo;s passing</a>, I&rsquo;ve spent the summer in New Hampshire. The marathon driving sessions wear on me, so I&rsquo;ve been avoiding them.</p>
<p>The driving was because I haven&rsquo;t found a good way to have my mother live alone for more than a few weeks at a time. I haven&rsquo;t worked out a strategy for getting her help while preserving as much of her independence as possible. So I&rsquo;ve been the help.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s a good thing, even if it often feels like I’m treading water. During my father’s final months, everything had to be about him. Now I’m able to take the time to work out my mother’s specific needs, even as she works out the business of living as a widow after more than sixty-five years of marriage.</p>
<p>Besides, a health issue has come up that we have to deal with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The war is a profound turning point, ending any pretense of “soft” authoritarianism with its modicum of space for resistance. The Kremlin’s fascist project may not succeed in the end, but it is crucial to see its effects within Russia as a fundamental component of the 2022 attack on Ukraine…. The Kremlin structures its war-making machine in ways that deliberately produce atrocity…. [And on TV, there is] a &ldquo;pedagogy&rdquo; of exterminist consciousness and practice, a key tool of the fascist project unfolding within and beyond Russia.</p>

			 <p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->press conference<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this afternoon reminds me of what a disaster we averted by showing the orange blob the door after one term.

			 <p>It&rsquo;s so hard to look away from Musk&rsquo;s wrecking ball when I go to Twitter for voices on Ukraine. Also hard not to comment on other people&rsquo;s posts. Now the would-be dictator of the bird site is banning and unbanning journalists, depending on his mood and random Twitter polls. He&rsquo;s also banning links to all kinds of outside networks, even Linktree. He might change his mind about some sites by playing the gracious leader who puts things to a plebiscite, but who needs that? More and more diehards are leaving. I&rsquo;d like to see regulators take an aggressive look at what he&rsquo;s doing. But I&rsquo;d also like to see media outlets, government offices, and other big institutions set up their own Mastodon servers to render the Big Twit&rsquo;s actions moot.</p>
<p>Evening update: Poof! Just like that, the latest stupid policies have vanished from the bird site&rsquo;s support pages, while Musk is conducting a poll about whether he should hire a different CEO in place of himself. Of course, none or all of these things could be true by morning.</p>

			 <p>The new owner of Twitter is turning that site into something of a dumpster fire, so I have set up an account on a Mastodon server as well. I&rsquo;m not sure where this will lead, but for scholarly communication, at least, it seems like a no-brainer, especially since so many have joined. At the same time, my fifteen-year Twitter habit will likely die hard because there are people and perspectives there that I can&rsquo;t get anywhere else, at least not yet.</p>

			 <p>Fifteen years ago, I wrote a short post encouraging students to <a href="/2007/05/23/on-writing/">write for themselves</a> on a regular basis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing is hard work for almost everyone, no matter how talented or inspired. Writing is thinking. Good writers do not usually have finished ideas that they then type out. The process of writing and revision is an act of thinking and discovery. . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A couple days ago, a tweet by a disaster historian came across my timeline that summed things up perfectly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221206013048/https://twitter.com/USofDisaster/status/1573191443669454849"><img src="https://mrstoneman.micro.blog/uploads/2024/294debe207.jpg" alt="Scott Gabriel Knowles: &ldquo;How do people who don&rsquo;t write know what they think about anything?&rdquo; (Sept 23, 2022)"></a><br>
( Tweet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220117202301/https://twitter.com/WmGermano/status/1427032243374104584">archived</a> on the Wayback Machine.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That Scott Knowles expressed this thought on Twitter reminds me that tweeting can also be a form of writing as thinking. This felt particularly true to me back in the 140-character-limit days; however, even with 280 characters and easy threading, Twitter can foster regular reflection, concise expression, and ongoing rephrasing and revision. Moreover, it affords plenty of opportunities to practice these things in conversation with others. Maybe that is what keeps me coming back, especially whenever times feel more topsy-turvy and worrisome than usual.</p>

			 <p>Perhaps Putin&rsquo;s phrase &ldquo;special military operation&rdquo; should be seen as something more insidious than a euphemism for war. At the very least, it is consistent with Russia&rsquo;s genocidal aims and practices in Ukraine.</p>
<p>If we take the Clausewitzian metaphor of war as a duel somewhat literally, the Russian invasion of Ukraine becomes a struggle between two equals, two entities with the same dignity, the same right to exist. After all, duels have traditionally been fought between two parties capable of giving satisfaction for a perceived injury by one to the other&rsquo;s honor. An officer could duel another officer, but not a sergeant, a lowly conscript, or a civilian occupying a more modest social position.</p>
<p>By calling its invasion a &ldquo;special military operation,&rdquo; Russia denies Ukraine&rsquo;s worthiness and sovereignty. It casts Ukraine and Ukrainians as other, fundamentally inferior, or devoid of honor, so to speak. Rejecting Ukrainian statehood outright, the term “special military operation” facilitates what the talking heads in Russia discuss openly on state TV: genocide, the elimination of Ukrainian culture, ethnicity, and language.</p>
<p>At the same time, the term &ldquo;special military operation&rdquo; renders Ukrainian resistance illegitimate in Russian eyes. Thus, Russia brands the soldiers who defended Mariupol to the end &ldquo;terrorists.&rdquo; And its leaders become apoplectic when Ukraine dares to fire on targets inside Russia and Russian-occupied Crimea.</p>
<p>Given the logic of Russia’s rhetoric and violence, the problem with &ldquo;special military operation&rdquo; becomes one not only of euphemism hiding war from Russians. The euphemism also creates space for, even favors, genocidal rhetoric and policy.</p>

			 <p>It feels strange to be back home in DC after nine months away in rural New Hampshire. And I&rsquo;m driving back up next week for my father&rsquo;s memorial service—driving because flying sounds like a terrible option these days.</p>
<p>My father was able to live at home for most of these past months. Facilitating that was a two-person job, mine and my octogenarian mother&rsquo;s. During his last month, he went from hospital to rehab, which I thought might become long-term care, but his old body had other plans.</p>
<p>Fortunately I already knew his wishes, so all three of us were on the same page when it came time. He was at the hospital when we switched him over to hospice care, a small hospital in the White Mountains, and the staff was brilliant.</p>
<p>My son made it up the last week, as did my sisters and one brother-in-law. Even my brother, who I hadn&rsquo;t seen in thirty years, flew in. On one of the last days the old man could speak, a nurse told him he was lucky. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>So it goes.</p>
<p>Early last fall, during a drive down to a different hospital to pick up my father,  my wife called me. Our first grandchild was coming. And then another call: she was there.</p>

<p>Crowds lining up to get their letters and newspapers at the post office on Pike and Clay Streets in San Francisco, California, ca. 1850.

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“The Children Were Watching,” dir. Robert Drew and Richard Leacock, USA 1961, 25 min.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; This documentary doesn’t feel as old to me as I wish it did. In part that’s because I watched it in Trump’s America during an especially difficult year, but something deeper is at play. The film’s ongoing relevance represents an ambiguous answer to its directors' main question: What were the children of a New Orleans neighborhood learning as they watched their parents during the conflicts surrounding school integration in November 1960?</p>

<p>To stand in Mann’s study today, with editions of Goethe and Schiller on the shelves, is to feel pride in the country that took him in and shame for the country that drove him out—not two Americas but one. In this room, the erstwhile “Greatest Living Man of Letters” fell prey to the clammy fear of the hunted. Was the year 1933 about to repeat itself? Would he be detained, interrogated, even imprisoned? In 1952, Mann took a final walk through his house and made his exit. He died in Zurich, in 1955—no longer an émigré German but an American in exile.</p>

			 <p>As a historian who sometimes teaches about Europe in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, I have to give Trump credit for one thing: His constant upending of the broad political consensus that emerged after World War II and the Cold War means that basic historical terms are constantly making it into the news and national discourse as quasi new problems, new questions. As upsetting as these times are, as abhorrent as Trump is, it is hard to deny the value of Ron Elving’s reaction to the president’s recent statement about being a nationalist: “We are about to have a national conversation about the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/10/24/660042653/what-is-a-nationalist-in-the-age-of-trump" title="What is a Nationalist in the Age of Trump">word nationalist</a>. And Elving wants to offer nuances to the term’s meanings in past and present—well, as much as anyone can in some 1,100 words.</p>

At the time, I did not appreciate the massive effort behind such compilation and systematization efforts. I just found these tools were quite practical for orienting myself in a given historical subject. Why didn&rsquo;t we have such useful tools in the United States?</p>
<p>Nowadays, it seems pretty clear to me that the difference had to do with how academic projects are organized and funded, and how their merits are perceived when hiring decisions are made. Perhaps, too, there is something in the academic culture that sees particular value in such projects, although I have no idea how one would separate such possible cultural predilections from the institutional organization of scholarship generally and of the discipline of history more specifically.</p>
<p>I do know that my doctoral advisor&rsquo;s approach to reading lists for our comprehensive exams at Georgetown University in the mid-to-late 1990s was unusual in the history department there. Roger Chickering gave us a massive bibliography for research purposes along with a so-called canon (read: very long list) of the texts that he expected every PhD student to know or at least know about.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> For my reading in Soviet, Imperial Russian, modern French, and modern British history, I had to write up my own reading lists, sometimes with suggestions by the professor, never with the ambitious, perhaps Sisyphean intention of producing a canon.</p>
<p>Roger Chickering, of course, is both product and producer of the American academic landscape, and he has deep ties in the German one too. The above example, however, is not meant to suggest that his approach was in any way related to its proximity to German academic culture. Instead, I mention it in order to underline what I sense is an additional reason for the (to my mind) weaker handbook culture in the United States, at least among historians. Such systematization is hard and its desirability not clear.</p>
<p>The nice thing about this blog is that it does not require massive overhead, although it does seem to have some institutional support. Nor must an entire handbook be conceived and created before anyone can use the knowledge being gathered and produced for it. The blog simply grows over time (since 2011) and can respond to new concerns and concentrations with tweaks to its categories and tags.</p>
<p>I bring this up because I was struck by a recent post on the francophone blog <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Germano-Fil<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a Franco-German production. The post is entitled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->“Recherche bibliographique en France et en Allemagne”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and contains a wonderfully useful list of resources, the kind I would like to have had when I was studying German history. This list would also fit in one of the more traditional handbooks, but it is on a blog and can be accessed easily via the site&rsquo;s category links, which act like a table of contents. Does such a detailed resource even exist in English for the study of German history? Hard to imagine.</p>
<p>There are other German websites that mirror the old handbook and encyclopedia culture more closely in that they are the products of specific research grants, and they begin with a structure, like a book, instead of waiting for a structure to emerge, as is possible on a blog. In its current iteration, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->German History in Documents and Images (GHDI)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a German–North American project, is organized in chronologically bounded volumes, each edited by a different historian (or team of historians).</p>
<p>Another site, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->historicum.net<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is a cross between a reference work and a reference library for students of history. Such an undertaking, of course, requires substantial institutional support, at least that is the impression I get from the extensive content, not to mention the logos of the project&rsquo;s sponsors—the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Universität Köln, and the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Docupedia-Zeitgeshichte<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> also recalls a multivolume handbook with a correspondingly large editorial team. Like on GHDI and <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->historicum.net<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Docupedia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s articles contain no tags or links to establish connections across entries. Instead, each piece reads like a traditional handbook article. In other words, the enterprise comports with the traditional research and writing practices of professional historians.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about blogs in terms of academic cultures for another reason as well. The above-mentioned blog has an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ISSN<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an identifier for periodicals. My encounters with academic blogs in the past decade or so have not involved this kind of identifier. Yet a number of academic blogs in Germany, at least blogs with some sort of institutional support, not to mention all blogs on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hypotheses<!-- raw HTML omitted --> portal, are now using the ISSN. Why?</p>
<p>According to the international organization behind this numbering system, “The ISSN role is to identify a publication,” thereby preventing possible confusion with similarly named publications, for example. But this “digital code [is] without any intrinsic meaning.” The ISSN contains no “information about the origin or contents of the publication,” and, most importantly in the present context, “it does not guarantee the quality or validity of the contents.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Nevertheless, on the blogs I have been encountering, this number appears to be about making the web publication look more serious or legitimate. In Germany at least, but maybe further afield, the ISSN can apparently make blogs accessible to library catalogs, as well as to an international open access directory called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ROAD<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; however, it is hard to escape the impression that for blogs, the ISSN is more about gaining recognition.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Academic culture might be a factor too.</p>
<p>Academic cultures with a long and deep history tend to influence the ways in which new media formats are used. Blogs, for example, offer the advantage of speed. One can put pixels to screen and share one’s thoughts almost instantly. Gatekeepers are practically nonexistent. Instead, it is up to bloggers to make clear who they are so that readers can judge for themselves the worthiness and reliability of the blog. In my view, these factors constitute advantages, but they can leave scholars uneasy, steeped as they are in a specific academic culture. Thus, some blogs take on the forms of more traditional academic publications.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->5<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>See, for example, the impressive and seemingly well-funded <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Verfassungsblog: On Matters Constitutional<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, whose posts often even include a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DOI<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a tool to ensure the long-term availability of a piece, even in the face of changing hyperlinks or dying websites. Aside from longevity, this approach might have the merit of making it easier for scholars to include any substantial blog posts they write on their curricular vitae. On the other hand, DOIs would seem to entail a prohibitive amount of extra work for many of us, perhaps militating against the rapid communication of ideas and research results that a blog can make possible.</p>
<p>Many research blogs give me the impression that their authors understand blogging and peer-reviewed journal publications as complementary. The former allows faster publication as well as more provisional and personal writings, but it in no way precludes developing one’s blogged thoughts further toward a peer-reviewed article or book. Conversation can also occur more easily in the blog format, since a response to one blog post can be written and published in a matter of mere hours or days, if that long. The benefits of such speed and interaction would seem to outweigh any need to &ldquo;legitimize&rdquo; a blog by adding the trappings of a more conventional periodical.</p>
<p>None of these observations amount to a specific argument or program, but I thought they might be worth sharing in the context of a blog about knowledge. Self-reflexivity should be part of any scholarly undertaking. Moreover, some of our contributors might be new to or skeptical about blogging as a form of scholarly communication and knowledge production.</p>

			 <p><img src="https://mrstoneman.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5144f7334b.jpg" alt="Detail from “Combat at the military station: Of Chateau d’ Eau, 24th February 1848 / combat au poste: Du Château d’ Eau, 24 Févr. 1848"></p>
<p><em>I wrote this preliminary introduction for a thematic handbook article that was not to be (see <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2015/11/09/historiographical-impasse/">&ldquo;Historiographical Impasse&rdquo;</a>). Looking back at this 2015 draft, I think it contains enough ideas to make it worth sharing.</em></p>
<p>If military service had become a rite of passage for young men in much of Europe well before the mutual slaughter began in the summer of 1914, neither its ubiquity nor its meaning to those it embraced were foregone conclusions. To be sure, the fundamental challenge offered by the declaration of the levée en masse in revolutionary France in 1793 represented an important first step, as did monarchical Prussia’s turn in 1813 to the near-general conscription of those men considered young and fit enough to join the fight. Indeed, Prussia’s response to the Napoleonic challenge intertwined military service, citizenship, and manhood in the gendered construction of a nation at war that bore a striking resemblance to those ideals manifest in the mobilizations of 1914.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Nonetheless, near-universal manhood conscription took many more decades to predominate on the continent (never mind the United Kingdom, which did not resort to it until 1916).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, the path was not at all direct, not from the state’s and army’s side nor from the general population’s. For the state and its military leadership, big citizens’ armies could be desirable for fighting a foreign enemy, but they could also present a threat to the domestic-political status quo because they might not allow themselves to be used to suppress protest or insurrection at home. A further decisive factor was technology and how military leaders came to use it. Especially important were the railroads and the development of strategic thought and organizational structures that placed a premium on mobilizing large numbers of men at once for a decisive blow of the kind Helmuth von Moltke pulled off for Prussia at Königgrätz (aka Sadowa) in 1866 and at Sedan in 1870 during the wars that produced a German nation-state.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Of course, an approach to war of this kind also required large numbers of trained conscripts and experienced reservists. But first things first. The men targeted by conscription (and then the reserves) and the families and communities in which they had been raised first needed to learn to see the state’s call to the colors as legitimate and inescapable, let alone perceive value in the prospect.</p>
<p>Nineteenth-century discourses and attitudes regarding conscription were informed by normative assumptions about manhood in connection with a wide range of topics—civic or national duty and martial sacrifice, forbearance and manliness, masculinity and bravery, willpower and human flesh versus modern weaponry (especially later in the century), the impact of length of service on soldiers’ relationship to civilian society, civilian upbringings and soldiers’ political reliability, the reputational impact of military service on veterans returning to civilian life, and so on. The gendered matrix of military service and citizenship was integral to warfare and its sociopolitical effects in Europe. This matrix is the subject of the first of three thematic sections comprising this [unrealized] chapter. Ordinary men in uniform occupy the center of this analysis, but other men and women who joined or supported the armed struggles—interstate and intrastate—are also considered.</p>
<p>The importance and meaning of conscription in this period was also affected by the increasing cachet of nationality as an organizing principle for the European state system, or at least as a cultural manifestation that states could leverage.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Whether in the ranks as conscripts, as substitutes for conscripts, as wartime volunteers, or by vocation, soldiers were beginning to be identified—and even identify themselves, at least in wartime—with the nation-state or the national cause that they served. Many fought in conflicts that had national resonance among the general population, such as the Crimean War (1853–56), and many others fought in wars that led to the creation of the Italian and German nation-states (achieved in 1861 and 1871, respectively). The last case also entailed the national humiliation of France—widely felt in that country—in a series of disastrous defeats (1870–71).</p>
<p>These conflicts did not just involve soldiers in the service of the state, however. The rise of nationality and “the people” as relevant factors saw men (and even women) join irregular formations to attain their national goals or, in the case of Italy, at least redeem their nation’s honor, whether that meant overturning a foreign or particularistic ruler (especially during the European revolutions of 1848) or defending their nation against a foreign invader or dying in the attempt. Or so the nationalist narratives went, even if some probably took up arms to defend their home and locality against the privations of requisitioning and marauding.</p>
<p>These decades also saw men and women (and youth) in cities resort to violence in order to change constitutional structures or protest economic and social conditions.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Whether or not any military experience was involved in the barricade building of 1848, memories of earlier revolts had certainly been passed down to the frequently subaltern generations of that time, a legacy that was also evident during the Paris Commune’s struggle in 1871.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Intertwined with implicit and explicit discourses about citizenship and belonging—and thus about manhood and womanhood, too—these episodes also belonged to the complex, often violent process of nation formation and consolidation. At the same time, in this context of nation-making wars and insurrections, the seemingly contradictory phenomenon of international volunteers serving a national cause must also be considered.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>The circles of social actors and norms to potentially include in a gendered analysis of the above mentioned wars and insurrections could be expanded a great deal further, if space constraints and available research permitted it. Whenever gender played a role in constructing or understanding the motivation and practices of those fighting, that role conceptually comprised both masculinity and femininity because gender, like class and race, is a relational concept. If the military world had become almost exclusively male and masculine in the nineteenth century, that manhood still presupposed relationships with women and femininity.</p>
<p>Normative femininity might be embodied in the appearance and comportment of women accompanying the army (in France, holdovers like the cantinère) or nursing the wounded (in the Crimea, Mary Seacole and Florence Nightingale). There were also the women at home for whom one fought, or the girl one intended to marry after completing active duty. Normative images of women in the minds of soldiers could affect those soldiers’ reactions to encounters with women in wartime, in the course of requisitioning food from civilians or sleeping in civilians’ homes or outbuildings—or when fighting irregulars or taking a town street by street. Finally, a siege army could not make distinctions between soldiers and civilians, men and woman, adults and children in a besieged city (as in the Prussian-German siege of Paris in 1870–71). On the other hand, policy decisions reached in the besieged city itself (or policy lacunae) could create great differences—between rich and poor, soldiers and civilians (and therefore also between men and women), and so on.</p>
<p>No matter how powerful memories of the levée en masse continued to be in the middle decades of nineteenth century France, to take the most famous example of a nation in arms, patriotism and élan were not enough to win wars. One also needed professional expertise to train and lead men in war or in the suppression of an insurrection. With different educational levels and frequently a more elevated social background, officers might well embody masculinity differently than the men in their charge, especially if they were noblemen. Furthermore, as military technologies grew and military organizations became more complex, the knowledge required by at least some of the officers expanded. As the job changed, so too could the men doing it.</p>
<p>These developments were accompanied by public and internal debates about military leadership. What qualities did officers require? From which stock was recruitment most desirable? What training did they require? What was their relationship to their men supposed to look like? How did they treat their subordinates? And what about their relationship to acknowledged social equals and supposed inferiors—especially men—outside the military? How did their expertise and comportment figure into their practice of masculinity and its reception? What did military service and sacrifice mean to these men? How did social background and family history shape that meaning? Finally, what about their private lives? How did marriage and family fit into their military careers? To what extent did the bourgeois ideal of a separate domestic sphere obtain in this context? Of course, each of these questions could lead to more than one answer because officer corps were by no means homogeneous.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Furthermore, some important military leaders did not fit within this framework at all, most prominently Giuseppe Garibaldi, whose biography, relationship to his fighters, and influential public image form an instructive counterpoint.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, if soldiers were citizens acting on behalf of the nation, their actions might be expected to bear a closer relationship to the values and norms that guided their behavior in civilian life. Actual or alleged practices in wartime that appeared contrary to the predominant normative conception of war—still largely informed by the metaphor of a dual between two equal and honorable parties—exposed the perpetrator to charges of acting in an unmanly or unwomanly way and, by extension, his or her nation to charges of dishonorable, uncivilized behavior. Purported atrocities and other perceived wrongdoings also created opportunities for soldiers to exact revenge with drastic countermeasures that could contradict taboos on destroying property and even those on killing women.</p>
<p>Of course, such measures were never just about the attitudes of soldiers, but also the command climate, discipline, and policy goals. Furthermore, gendered contemporary reports and commentaries on the violence could be more about demonizing the enemy than about actual events or understanding what happened. The main examples explored in this section involve face-to-face encounters between German soldiers and French civilians in 1870–71 and the extreme use of violence by Thiers’s forces against the Commune in 1871.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
<p>All three sections [so was my plan] proceed from the fundamental premise that practices and experiences of manhood and womanhood are historically contingent, that men and women change over time, that normative masculinities and femininities change with them. The seemingly natural in their attitudes and behaviors is cultural and therefore a product of history. The second corollary premise is that war and warriors are creatures of their times, influenced by—and influencing—them. Contrary to many narrowly conceived histories, not to mention widespread ahistorical elements of popular culture, there is no universal soldier or military leader.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> Here, too, biology need not be destiny, whereas culture, if not properly analyzed in historical context, very well could be.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
<p>The third premise is that although the dual political and technological revolutions of the nineteenth century match up chronologically with the emergence of “total war” in the twentieth century, the journey never involved only a single plot line that led inexorably to 1914. Focusing on the role of gender—a fundamental component of human culture—can help to make other formative strands of the story visible. It then becomes possible to complicate Stig Förster’s powerful typology of warfare’s development in the modern era—cabinet war, people’s war, industrialized people’s war, and total war—whose emphasis on parallel developments in war and politics can resemble a teleology, one subverted by events after 1945 and hard to reconcile with developments in warfare in other eras and cultures.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p>

			 <p>Am still shaking my head over the new administration’s discriminatory ban on Muslims entering the United States. It was no surprise after the hateful rhetoric of the election season, but announcing it on Holocaust Remembrance Day? And not mentioning Jews in a statement about the Holocaust? I wish I could call these actions tone-deaf, but they feel more intentional and sinister than that, even if the more apt historical parallels are the U.S. rejection of Jews fleeing Nazism and the internment of Japanese-Americans as an entire class of people during the Second World War.</p>

			 <p>One of the new research focuses at the GHI since our director, Simone Lässig, began her tenure last October is the history of knowledge.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The study of knowledge in its societal context (as opposed to thought experiments about truth in the discipline of philosophy) has some tradition in sociology and anthropology, but it is still a relatively new focus in English-language historiography, at least in my experience.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>A good introduction for me was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Peter Burke, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What is the History of Knowledge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (polity, 2016)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It says more about what the field can encompass than it does about historiographical debates or plausible narratives. Still, for an outsider like me, the book offers helpful vocabulary and categories with which to begin thinking about this subject. A different kind of text that I also found useful is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ian F. McNeely and Lisa Wolverton, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reinventing Knowledge: From Alexandria to the Internet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2008)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If the focus is on the West and elite knowledge, and if it offers generalizations that specialists might pick apart, it has the merit of offering a narrative that helps the reader to think about the production, preservation, transmission, and consumption of knowledge over a long span of time. I find such historical narratives absolutely necessary when first getting my feet wet in a subject.</p>
<p>Knowledge history can encompass faith traditions and the academic disciplines, of course, but it can go well beyond that to all walks of life, whether the knowledge is explicit or implicit, published or produced and transmitted in a workshop, and so on. With its interest in what people know and how they produce, use, and disseminate this knowledge, knowledge history does not feel all that strange from the perspective of social and cultural history. Indeed, knowledge history seems capable of dovetailing productively with these more familiar approaches.</p>
<p>In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Isabel Hull, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Absolute Destruction<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (Cornell UP, 2006)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for example, we learn that army officers in Imperial Germany shared a certain understanding and approach to war despite their diverse training, career paths, and experiences; however, we never learn how they came to share this common military culture. If we consider what these men <!-- raw HTML omitted -->knew<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about war, we still have a phenomenon whose cultural logic can be unpacked, but now we can also start asking about the education, training, and acculturation that helped transform young men into military professionals. In other words, we can begin to think about how and what officers learned and knew as well as how they produced and transmitted this knowledge. In this way, a static image of culture becomes dynamic, capable of changing over time.</p>
<p>The history of knowledge is not all that foreign to the business and consumption history I edited under the previous director either, even if that history has not been written with the history of knowledge in mind or in the vein of cultural history. The most interesting book of this type I encountered was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hartmut Berghoff, Philip Scranton, and Uwe Spiekermann, eds., <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Rise of Marketing and Market Research<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (Palgrave, 2012)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The titles of its individual chapters might sound highly specialized, but together they show how different social and economic actors came to conceive and understand the markets in which they were operating in ways that modernday ideological adherence to capitalism as a natural, ahistorical phenomenon remains oblivious. The subtitle of the introduction includes the term “information” (not “knowledge”) but many of the examples in the book show entrepreneurs and others producing knowledge, that is, coming up with new ways to understand society and gather and use data to sell goods.</p>
<p>In hindsight, I think I found this particular book so interesting because of the knowledge aspect of the topic. For example, in “Making the Ledgers Talk: Customer Control and the Origins of Data Mining,” Josh Lauer shows how U.S. department stores in the early decades of the twentieth century had credit departments—not necessarily profitable—as a service to their customers. Yet some people in these departments came to understand how much sales data they were sitting on and began to use it to target specific kinds of customers with direct mail campaigns, based on their specific purchase histories. In other words, these credit departments took information already on hand and transformed it into new knowledge about their customers that could be used to increase sales.</p>

			 <p>I have had to withdraw from an interesting handbook project because of excessive overlap with two other chapters. My topic was on the matrix of gender, war, and nation in European wars in the 1850s through the 1870s. Given the limited historiography, I chose a thematic approach, but that produces the undesired overlap. What is needed instead, I&rsquo;m told, is a gendered history of these specific wars. Leaving aside the insufficient historiography, to say nothing of the challenges inherent in collaborations of this kind, where project requirements and individual research have to somehow come together and adapt to changing parameters, the impasse I&rsquo;ve reached seems to have deeper epistemological roots.</p>
<p>Making sense of the matrix of gender, nation, and war in the European conflicts of the mid-nineteenth century appears to involve contradictory historiographical impulses. On the one hand, the revolutions, insurrections, and wars of this era represented discrete political events in specific temporal, geographic, social, cultural, economic, and technological contexts. On the other hand, solidarities or identities represented by the nation emerged and achieved hegemonic status over much longer periods of time (even if war acted as a catalyst), to say nothing of the resilient normative and structural operations of gender in human societies.</p>
<p>If one scholar has successfully identified a discursive relationship among nationalism, military service, and the masculine construction of citizenship in Prussia during the Wars of Liberation against Napoleon, making the leap from those discourses to changes in gender norms (including the shifting meaning of military service in a man&rsquo;s life) and how gender operated in social hierarchies is another matter. Depending on the region of Europe, it could take many decades for such discourses to manifest themselves in ordinary people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>These contradictory historiographical impulses are also evident in gender history itself. If the field (earlier conceived as women&rsquo;s history) had initially promised to challenge and subvert conventional periodization schemes, the professional requirements of specialization in specific eras and regions has tended to reproduce those schemes instead.</p>
<p>If I have been unable to navigate these tensions and contradictions within the limited scope left open to me in the handbook project and given the limitations of the historiography itself, I nonetheless find myself wondering how they might be addressed within event-driven history more generally. Clearly one can explore the operations of gender in a specific war, but is it possible to draw conclusions about changes in gender norms and gender orders without taking a much longer view? I am skeptical.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One evening after work recently, I was half-starved and wanted something I could cook quickly. I saw some packaged gnocchi in the cupboard, made by De Cecco, which I thought would fit the bill, until I started reading the directions. Unfortunately, these were quite long, and they mentioned all kinds of ingredients not in the package, so I gave up. I didn’t want a detailed recipe. I just wanted to know how to cook the gnocchi. A few days later, while editing an English translation of a book about Italians and food in the modern era, I learned something that made me go back to the gnocchi.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In the early post–World War II decades, when the Italian food industry was trying to get consumers—in this context mainly women—to buy its new, ready-made food products, it decided that offering detailed preparation suggestions for the integration of other foods into its packaged products would improve the image of the new products, that is, make them more legitimate and appealing. But consumers bought ready-made foods for their convenience, not for the opportunity to prepare something elaborate. If one wanted to make something more involved, one could do it the old-fashioned way, from scratch, even if one might use certain intermediate manufactured goods like bouillon cubes or dry pasta.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>With this nugget about Italy’s food history in hand, I went back to the gnocchi package whose directions had thwarted me earlier. I still found only one very detailed paragraph, nothing short about the gnocchi themselves, as pasta packages in this country have led me to expect. But this time I decided I had better skip ahead in the directions, and, sure enough, what I needed was there, buried near the end: “In the meantime, cook the gnocchi in plenty of boiling salted water, remove them as they rise to the surface …” So that was what the “ready in 2 min.” label on the front of the package was referring to. Apparently this step is such common knowledge in Italy that there is no reason to highlight it in readily accessible instructions, even if the manufacturer still feels the need to make its product more attractive to potential customers with a detailed recipe.</p>
<p>But the package in my hand was for the American market, so why attach the same, apparently decades-old assumptions about food and gender in Italy to it? It hardly makes sense, except if explained in terms of the product’s postwar Italian history. Language from that context seems to have been translated into English without giving much thought to this context. Or is this a way to market something very ordinary, little potato dumplings, as something special? In any case, I’m pretty sure that the packaged gnocchi my European spouse bought for the pantry still carry part of their history in the accompanying directions, which at least I can read now.</p>

			 <p>At a recent lecture on the Great War, Roger Chickering said, “I&rsquo;m not a military historian.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The phrase stuck in my mind because he said it two more times during the course of the lecture and discussion. I’m sure he was trying to avoid letting the discussion get sidetracked by narrower debates about military operations, which was fair enough in the context of his talk about a series of common structural elements in Germany’s, France’s, and Great Britain’s wars. Nonetheless, his words bothered me.</p>
<p>Of course, there was nothing surprising about the statement. And Chickering really can’t be called a “military historian” in the narrow sense of the term. Nor can I, his former student. But if stating that one is “not a military historian” makes sense in terms of the prejudices of too many academic historians, it also cedes the ground of professional competence to those historians who only focus on the battlefield.</p>
<p>As legitimate as narrower operational and tactical studies of warfare are, their authors cannot be allowed to enjoy a monopoly on the interpretation of the more military-technical aspects of warfare. The broad expertise and perspective of the historian who studies war’s manifestations away from the violence is also needed for the battlefield and everywhere else that people were killing or being killed for ostensibly political aims.</p>

			 <p>The main assignment for my graduate survey of modern Europe this summer was to write an essay that incorporated all of the assigned books and most of the assigned articles. I conceived of this assignment because of a similar one that I had had to do as a graduate student that I found especially productive, if difficult. (See <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2010/08/14/learning-to-synthesize.html">Learning to Synthesize History</a>.)</p>
<p>The essays my students wrote fulfilled or exceeded my expectations in some cases, but there were others that did not go as well as they could have. In part, this was due to the compressed nature of the summer term, but more than anything else, I think building a deliberate approach to teaching the process of synthesis into the course syllabus would have helped. Yes, these students were in an M.A. program and had taken many history courses in their lives, but few had ever had to do such an assignment.</p>
<p>Of course, we spoke about process both in class and in individual meetings, but the current senior research seminar I am teaching, which includes explicit work on process, suggests to me that I should formalize such efforts in graduate courses too, if I am going to require an unfamiliar writing task. That&rsquo;s not how I learned as a graduate student, but so what?</p>

			 <p>My research deals with war and society, while my editorial work addresses mainly consumption history. One might think these are two different worlds, but I&rsquo;m coming to doubt the validity of such assumptions. Indeed, the subfields of military and business history have a lot of similarities. Most obviously, they are both interested in organizations, knowledge, experts, and elites—among other things. They are also both informed by a tension between the historian&rsquo;s ethos to understand the past for its own sake and the practitioner&rsquo;s desire to learn lessons from that past for today. And they both have homes not only in history departments, but also institutions that train future generations of professionals, whether officers or MBAs. This tension also means that military history and business history are sometimes looked down on by the field of history more generally, even though bread-and-butter themes such as class, race, gender, citizenship, politics, and power more generally cannot be adequately understood without consideration of militaries and businesses.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Yesterday I asked how I could integrate the consumption history <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m learning<!-- raw HTML omitted --> into my teaching, and I pointed to a couple examples where it&rsquo;s already there. But I missed a glaringly obvious one: the Great War.</p>
<p>Consumption is a vital part of the story in Gerald Feldman&rsquo;s classic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Army, Industry, and Labor in Germany, 1914—1918<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (1966), insofar as the purchasing power of labor was inextricably linked to Germany&rsquo;s social and political stability and, therefore, the country&rsquo;s ability to produce sufficient armaments to continue fighting. The point is more accessible in Roger Chickering, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914—1918<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (1998 and 2004), which I have used in a course on the Great War and will use again next fall in one on modern Germany. There is also Belinda Davis, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Home Fires Burning: Food, Politics, and Everyday Life in World War I Berlin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (2000), which I will be using in a graduate course on war and society this summer.</p>
<p>I also usually bring up a much earlier aspect of consumption history when I address the Enlightenment and the public sphere: coffee houses. To make this point, there is a delightful reading from before the Enlightenment on the Internet Modern History Sourcebook: &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The First English Coffee-Houses, c. 1670—1675<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, none of this is informed by a specific historiography of consumption history, but it does point out how this topic is already in my teaching. But there&rsquo;s a difference between including a topic and addressing it systematically. To think about war and society in Europe, I can at least draw on the periodizing nomenclature of &ldquo;cabinet war,&rdquo; &ldquo;people&rsquo;s war,&rdquo; and &ldquo;total war&rdquo; to help describe the level of societal involvement in interstate conflicts over the past few centuries (Stig Förster et al.). If such language and periodization exists for understanding consumption history, I have not yet learned it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the main point is to recognize modern consumer societies as having a history in the first place, instead of taking them as a direct reflection of human nature and, hence, rendering them ahistorical, as too often happens in simplistic political rhetoric that opposes capitalism and communism—rhetoric that invariably finds its way into student spoken and written comments. I sometimes try to do this with economic thought in the early modern period, but historicizing capitalism should be a central historiographical problem for the modern era, too.</p>

			 <p>I had no plagiarism cases this fall. Maybe it is because I had an unusually ethical group of students, but it probably also had something to do with analysis they did based on short documents instead of books commonly discussed on the internet. With few exceptions, there were no answers to be found on the internet, though I took some chances with the inclusion of <em>A Doll&rsquo;s House</em> in some questions. Even then, I did not let students focus on Ibsen&rsquo;s play, but instead forced them to relate it to short documents that I made available on Blackboard. I have made similar attempts in the past, but usually by asking big synthetic questions based on two or three books instead of narrower interpretive questions based mainly on two or three specific documents.</p>
<p>Another variable was length. These source analysis exercises were only two pages, if that, which might have been short enough to prevent the kind of panic that leads to some plagiarism cases. Of course, two pages is less than ideal, but I had more than 150 students this past fall. Even with a grader to help me 10 hours per week, there was an enormous amount of assessment to do, especially since there were three of these exercises.</p>
<p>On a related note, in the coming semester I am going over to the dark side with some quizzes and parts of my exams. By that I mean I will be integrating some multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank elements. As much as I prefer to have students actively produce knowledge in exams, there is a limit to how much grading I can and should do, a limit I far exceeded last semester. Moreover, I will still be having them do analysis. Unfortunately, multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions can raise the specter of copying in overcrowded classrooms. It is with this issue in mind that I plan to use multiple versions of quizzes and exams. I am just not sure if I will have to create these by hand or if there is an easy and free technological solution.</p>

			 <p>George Mason&rsquo;s Hist 100 courses are supposed to cover Western Civilization in one semester. To manage this Sisyphean task, I switched from a chronological to a thematic approach. While this makes sense from an analytic point of view, covering themes seems to alienate some students, because the themes appear in the foreground, not the events and personalities. Moreover, the themes tend to bridge larger periods of time. With &ldquo;Religion and Society,&rdquo; for instance, I cover the Investiture Conflict, the Protestant and Catholic Reformations, the Wars of Religion, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment. And &ldquo;War and Society&rdquo; goes from the French Revolution through the Second World War into the Cold War.</p>
<p>The material in my thematic courses has been organized in a more meaningful way than was possible under a broad chronological approach, but it has not held students' attention. That is why I am thinking about covering a selection of specific episodes the next time around. I could put these up front and use the people, ideas, and issues involved as a vehicle to understand the broader themes that I want them to learn. A possible subtitle for such a course might be &ldquo;Select Events and Ideas,&rdquo; which might also make the history feel more manageable to the students.</p>

			 <p>The summer term is upon me. Here is this summer’s version of “Western Civ” at George Mason University and “Euro Civ I” at Georgetown University. Both courses are thematically organized. Neither has electronic assignments due to the compressed time period in which everything has to be done. Euro Civ I has only papers. Western Civ has papers and source analysis homework. In the latter case I figure the additional structure might be helpful, because the course has to bring students right up to the present. Of course, some students are going to hate me for it, which a reminder of the absence of exams might or might not ameliorate.</p>
<p>By the way, Euro Civ II will probably be chronologically&mdash;not thematically&mdash;organized. For that course I have the luxury of a whole term to cover only two hundred years of history.</p>

<p>The success of this discussion was also due in part to another issue. I have begun to &ldquo;legitimate confusion&rdquo; for my students,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that is, I have begun to cultivate an awareness in them of just how hard historical interpretation can be and how important learning how to ask questions can be. With this attitude, students can explore sources and ideas honestly and thoughtfully without fear of getting it wrong and looking bad. With such an awareness, students were willing to attempt the leaps of imagination necessary to navigate among three different time periods, the early twenty-first century, the nineteen thirties and forties, and the first few decades of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>I might try this book again, though I could also do with a change. Perhaps some of you have some ideas?</p>

			 <p>Almost anyone who has lived in Germany over the past sixty years will find the following video very strange indeed.

<p>Dr. Suess also addressed the question of war and peace in a famous children&rsquo;s book from the Cold War, <em>The Butter Battle Book</em>. In it, one side ate its bread butter side up, and the other butter side down, leading to mistrust, the erection of a wall, and an arms race.</p>

			 <p>Checking out his email in the kitchen and talking to Reverend Sloan, B.D. says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Man, does Ray seem down lately. He keeps asking if people at home still support the troops—as if most Americans actually had a personal stake. Emotionally, we outsourced this war—to a professional class that mainstream America has almost no contact with. Most people are completely baffled why anyone would serve. Ray has no idea how isolated he really is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zonker sits down and says, &ldquo;Boy B.D., when you&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; Boopsie, B.D.&rsquo;s wife, agrees and asks, &ldquo;Should we send Ray something to show we&rsquo;re thinking of him. Zonker suggests a box of medals. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t soldiers like medals?&rdquo; Enthusiastic, Boopsie replies, &ldquo;I know B.D. does. Good thought!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, B.D. is covering his face with his left hand and looking down in disbelief, disgust, or despair, while the reverend tells him, &ldquo;You can rest your case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meet Wilhelm Groener, an unassuming Swabian of modest social provenance who rose to the number two position in the Imperial German army by the end of the First World War. Here he is in about 1920, soon after his retirement from the army in the young Weimar Republic.</p>
<p>Groener, the subject of my dissertation, informed Kaiser Wilhelm II in November 1918 that the army would not follow him back to Prussia to fight a civil war to quash the revolution. Confronted with this reality, Wilhelm II abdicated and fled to the Netherlands.</p>
<p>By rights Groener&rsquo;s boss, Chief of the General Staff Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, should have delivered the bad news, but he was a Prussian officer and nobleman, imbued in the traditions of military service to his supreme war lord, the Prussian king and German emperor. Hindenburg did not have the nerve.</p>
<p>Groener was present at the death of another German regime too. He served as minister of defense from 1928 to 1932. Near the end of this tenure he was also acting minister of the interior in the Brüning cabinet. In this capacity he pushed to outlaw Hitler&rsquo;s brown-shirts, the S.A., which gave right-wing extremists in the army a chance to withdraw their support of the defense minister and prevail upon President Hindenburg to withdraw his confidence from Groener, who then resigned. Soon the rest of the cabinet did too, and Hitler came to power less than a year later.</p>
<p>Groener witnessed and participated in some of modern Germany&rsquo;s key political events, but that is not what I wrote about in my dissertation. Instead, I focussed on the relationship between his social background and military career, which was interesting precisely because he rose to such prominence in an organization alleged to have been the exclusive playground of the Prussian nobility.</p>
<p>At least that is how my research started.</p>

			 <p>History can be used to justify all manner of circumstances in the present. Want to justify an authoritarian regime in Russia? Referring to Russia&rsquo;s present conditions can help, but even more effective can be skillful tradition-building that shows Russia&rsquo;s long line of great authoritarian rulers. And what better place to start than with history teachers in the schools?</p>
<p><em>The New York Times</em> published <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a remarkable article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> yesterday about a new history guide for high school teachers in Russia. After a brief introduction, it offers verbatim excerpts on Stalin, who comes away smelling like roses, despite his massive purges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stalin followed Peter the Great’s logic: demand the impossible from the people in order to get the maximum possible. . . . The result of Stalin’s purges was a new class of managers capable of solving the task of modernization in conditions of shortages of resources, loyal to the supreme power and immaculate from the point of view of executive discipline. . . .</p>
<p>Thus, just like Chancellor Bismarck who united German lands into a single state by “iron and blood,” Stalin was reinforcing his state by cruelty and mercilessness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is quite an intellectual feat to bring Stalin into line with both Peter the Great and Otto von Bismarck. Indeed, such relativism reveals something about the Kremlin&rsquo;s self-image these days. It would be helpful to see the rest of the guide before drawing broader conclusions. Still, does not the following statement recall some of Putin&rsquo;s own criticisms of democracy in the United States in recent years?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Political and historical studies show that when they come under similarly serious threats, even “soft” and “flexible” political systems, as a rule, turn more rigid and limit individual rights, as happened in the United States after September 11, 2001.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, history textbooks matter.</p>

<p>These stereoptic cards offer a tale of war reduced to two basic elements: soldiers on parade at home followed by the unburied corpses of soldiers on the battlefield. How should we read this story? At first glance, it seems to be about the gap between dreams and reality in war: the transformation of men from objects of admiration in society to a meal for rats, bugs, worms, and microbes in a foreign wasteland. In other words, the pictures seem to tell a story about the utter senselessness of the First World War. But does that interpretation do justice to the lives of these men? Does it tell us why they wore the uniform and sacrificed their lives? Does it tell us about their experience of war? And what about the politicians and generals who sent millions to their deaths? Can we write them off as insane or incompetent fools? Or should we take them seriously and try to fathom their mental universe? Finally, what lasting effects did this violence and loss have on the societies that fought this war? These are some of the questions that inform my interest in military history.</p>

			 <p>When I went to the student coffee shop on Friday, the student at the cash register guessed my order before I could tell him what I wanted. I remarked that I had had similar experiences with regulars when I worked at a Dunkin' Donuts over twenty years ago. His response: &ldquo;They had Dunkin' Donuts back then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For me there has always been a Dunkin' Donuts. Indeed, according to Wikipedia and the corporate website of Dunkin' Donuts, the first store opened in 1950, which is close enough to &ldquo;always&rdquo; for someone born in the early 1960s. So why did the student think Dunkin' Donuts was new? His own answer was eminently practical: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t even been alive for twenty years.&rdquo; Still, his underlying assumption that so much of the world around him was new took me aback.</p>
<p>Maybe I should not have been surprised by his presentism. After all, the current generation of students has grown up hearing that they live in a completely different world than the one into which I was born. They have heard from their parents and teachers about a bygone world in the midst of a Cold War without personal computing, the internet, cell phones, iPods, and global warming. And then there are the many students who have grown up in new subdivisions, schools and strip malls.</p>
<p>What do these thoughts have to do with me and Clio? One of my main goals in undergraduate survey courses is to teach historical thinking, which in part entails helping students appreciate not only that the world has a past, but that the people in that past saw that world through different eyes. But it is not enough for me to ask them to see how the world looks when it is filtered through the experiences of earlier generations. In order to do my job, I find it helps if I meet them halfway and try to understand how the world looks when filtered through their experiences. Of course, I usually end up looking uncool in the process, but as the father of a teenager I am used to that.</p>

			 <p>I was looking through Friedrich Dürrenmatt&rsquo;s <em>The Physicists</em>, a play I have used a few times in a survey course on modern Europe. In the back of the English translation by James Kirkup are &ldquo;21 Points to The Physicists,&rdquo; one of which reads, &ldquo;The more human beings proceed by plan the more effectively they may be hit by accident.&rdquo; This quote sums up my recently completed dissertation on three levels that I would like to consider: the content of my research from the point of view of its historical subjects, the path my research takes from my point of view, and the shape of the narrative that eventually emerges. I plan to look at these paradoxes in future posts at irregular intervals. For now I will mention a different one that is not as difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>I spent four years in the U.S. Army during peacetime, and I disliked being a soldier. I also rarely found military history interesting. Nonetheless, my research has focused on war. My M.A. thesis is about Bavarian soldiers and French civilians in the Franco-Prussian War, and my Ph.D. thesis is about the Imperial German officer corps and war planning. How did a former soldier who hated his experience in the military come to enjoy studying military history?</p>
<p>At least part of the answer lies in my military experience. A kid from the woods of New Hampshire had a lot of learning to do in a unit in which most everyone else came from the inner city or rural south. Add class, race, and educational levels to this mix, and I got a first-rate education. You see, I was not just in the army, but combat arms, specifically, the field artillery. When I enlisted I made the naive assumption that the army was the army no matter what one did, and it was offering a substantial bonus for four years in the artillery. So why not? Without going into a longer story, let me say that I left the army in 1987 with an insight of which at the time I was unaware: studying the army can teach a person a lot about that army&rsquo;s country.</p>
<p>Not until I was doing my M.A. in Augsburg, Germany did I realize that I knew this. I think it was late 1992 or early 1993 when I met Professor Stig Förster, who had just returned to Europe from a stint at the German Historical Institute in Washington, DC. Stig was editing <em>On the Road to Total War: The American Civil War and the German Wars of Unification, 1861-1871</em>, and I, as an American there, was recruited as one of his student helpers. I found the topics interesting, because in a seminar I had recently taken with another historian, we had learned about the lead-up to the war and the postwar settlement, but the war just kind of happened. I remarked on this circumstance to Stig. One thing led to another and he suggested I could explore the Bavarians' treatment of civilians in 1870–71 for my master&rsquo;s thesis. The topic sounded interesting, but also vaguely pornographic. Was it even decent to probe into such suffering? At the same time, scenes from Bosnia on TV suggested to me that such topics mattered. Before making up my mind, I asked if there was an historical treatment of these kinds of issues that might show me the historical value of examining atrocities. That led to Michael Fellman, <em>Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict In Missouri During The American Civil War</em>, as well as James M. McPherson, <em>Battle Cry Of Freedom: The Civil War Era</em>. Of course, I also dug into Michael Howard&rsquo;s perennial <em>The Franco-Prussian War: The German Invasion of France, 1870-71</em>. These books showed me that the study of war was integral to mainstream history and vice versa. With war being fought once again on European soil (the Balkans), I not only was hooked, but I thought such studies were a moral imperative.</p>
<p>Having completed a PhD program and many years of teaching, I no longer see my research in such grandiose terms. Still, I try to integrate at least one lecture on broad trends in war and society into each survey course I teach. I think students need to know that human behavior in war is historically contingent. They need to know, for instance, that humanity and atrocities in warfare have a history. The list is much longer, of course, but I can revisit the topic another time.</p>

			 <p>Do partisan politics have a place in the classroom? No. On the other hand, in a history class it is hard, even impossible to discuss many subjects without politics forming a subtext of the conversation. This difficulty is especially inherent in modern history. How, for example, can we talk about state-building, gender roles, participatory politics, and political ideologies without entering terrain in which we have a personal stake? And once we do that, how do we keep out partisan politics?</p>
<p>The trick is to make that difficult mental leap into the past and try to understand it from the point of view of people who lived in that time. We do not need to take sides with our ideological forefathers, and we do not need to attack their opponents. Nor do we need to respond to problems in the past with solutions from the present. Instead we need to try to think historically. We need to try to understand people in the past in their historical contexts. Making that leap is difficult, but possible.</p>
<p>Ironically, good civic practices are one potential side-effect of cultivating such historical sensibilities. If we can learn to imagine how people thought in the past, maybe we can imagine how our political opponents think in the present. Once we reach that point, a genuine dialog might be possible. The problems might be just as inextricable, but we might learn how to talk with each other instead of at each other. In other words, when we study history, it is possible to acquire the communicative habits necessary for a healthy civic culture. Partisan politics do not belong in the classroom, but the classroom might have some lessons for partisan politics.</p>

			 <p>Writing is hard work for almost everyone, no matter how talented or inspired. Writing is thinking. Good writers do not usually have finished ideas that they then type out. The process of writing and revision is an act of thinking and discovery. That is why writing papers can be so frustrating and rewarding at the same time. Want to improve your prose? Keep a journal, in which you produce a page of text per day. The text can be about anything, but use standard prose, not the kind of abbreviations and lack of capitalization that you might use in informal emails or IMs with friends. The text should also be honest. This exercise is akin to doing regular physical exercise, practicing music, or learning a foreign language. The more you do it, the better you get. The less you do it, the worse you get.</p>
