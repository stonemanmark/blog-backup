			 <p><a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts.app</a> is a flexible and powerful workhorse on my phone and tablet, but I&rsquo;ve always been irritated by the way its windows work on the Mac. The main window is always the same size, whether it is just text or I have one or two sidebars open. By contrast, I&rsquo;m used to Mac apps treating sidebars like a drawer. If I open one, the text window maintains its width and the side bar opens out further.</p>
<p>Today I played a little trick on myself and used Drafts in full-screen mode with an app next to it. In that context, the behavior of Drafts actually makes sense to me. (I&rsquo;m not making a general statement about the app&rsquo;s design. Instead, as with most software, I am interested in how well it works for me and the expectations I&rsquo;ve internalized over the years.)</p>
<p>Having learned this about Drafts, I might be able to make it do more for me on the Mac. Till now, I&rsquo;ve mainly used it to look up old notes and to get ephemeral text snippets from one device to another. (I feel confident about the app because its notes are stored in JSON files. That means the contents of the backups it regularly does are easy to access with any text editor, regardless of whether I continue to have the app.)</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been <a href="https://markstoneman.com/search/?q=a+short-lived+blogger+site+of+mine+on+my+mac">adding posts</a> from a short-lived blog called On My Mac. While doing this, I sometimes hit send before I&rsquo;ve added a title or set the right date (2007, not 2025). I can fix these errors on my blog right away, but they might still carry over on the blog&rsquo;s Fediverse feed. Sorry about that.</p>

<blockquote>Hayward, California [1940]. Youth on Relief. Looking in his pocket for his surplus commodities card. 'Not having a job is bad enough, but you keep goin' down and purty soon you're here and the spirit is gone. I turn my face when somebody I know real well comes along the sidewalk. It takes the spirit when you're in here and then you haven't anything left.'</blockquote>

<p>This image stems from a federal food aid program during the Great Depression. For me, the quoted recipient of aid represents a familiar story about pride, dignity, shame, and fear that the self-righteous who reject the provision of such aid fail to grasp.</p>

			 <p>My <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2025/10/07/in-a-moment-of-insanity.html">initial reaction</a> to iOS 26 was with &ldquo;reduced transparency&rdquo; turned on. This setting even causes all the little floating menus to be surrounded by an excessive and useless layer of screen-hogging white that hides parts of the screen that were visible under iOS 18. The accessibility setting &ldquo;reduced transparency&rdquo; needs a much more nuanced implementation. It is unconscionable that they didn&rsquo;t design Apple Glass with accessibility in mind from the get-go.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m watching &ldquo;Keeper of the Flame&rdquo; (1942) on HBO Max. A few things in the first third have already got me wondering about the unsettling direction in which I am headed with this wartime release.</p>
<p>Good and bad tended to be more clearly demarcated than what I have seen so far: an uncanny tone surrounding a dead American hero (so-called), the fictional organizations Forward America and Robert Forrest Boys Army for America, the synergy between the dead man and the press, and some on-point quotes about fascists out to enslave us&mdash;not with chains but by sowing division and taking hold of our imaginations and loyalty.</p>
<p>Sometimes not knowing is more suspense than I can handle, so I was glad to find a review that confirmed my hunches without offering any spoilers.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://markstoneman.com/uploads/2025/ord-midwest-ms-head-postcards-box-00002-01.jpg"><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/166262/2025/bessa-to-frances-photo-m.jpg" width="100%" alt="Postcard with a photo of a woman from above the waist. She is wearing a man's suit and a top hat, and she has a pipe in left side of her mouth. The look on her face is playful."></a></p>
<p>The modern-day archival title of this old postcard is a gender-neutral "Person in top hat and pipe", although the person pictured appears to be a woman. That there is something gender-bending or gender-ambiguous about it is confirmed by the message on the back, presumably from the person photographed, who was travelling in Ohio.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sept. 16, 1907</p>
<p>Dear Frances–</p>
<p>I just couldn't help it, and I knew you would want one, even tho you do have to hide it. I've had some good ones taken and will send you one as soon as they are finished. I've had a lovely time in Galion, but I leave in the morning for Mt. Vernon for a ten day visit then to Columbus and Zanesville for a few days. Dea had me read your letters. I'm glad you are feeling so <u>fine</u>. Yours lovingly Bessa</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The condition of the postcard is immaculate because it was not sent in the clear as a postcard but instead placed in an envelope. Note how the handwritten text filled the entire back of the card, covering both the message half and the address half.</p>
<p>The reasons for Bessa's apparently subversive appearance are unclear, but three possibilities come to mind. She could have been a dress reformer, or maybe an entertainer, or simply someone for whom this manner of dress aligned most closely with her sense of self. Regardless, the look on her face and the tone of her text makes me think she she would have been a lovely person to know.</p>

			 <p>Today on Bluesky, Anna Lind-Guzik <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alindguzik.bsky.social/post/3lzo5myqj322r">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a reason mass shooters, whether they’re disaffected brain rotted teens, or adults who kill their families, are men. Obsession with status and control through violence is fundamentally political and patriarchal, and to suggest it isn’t is to totally ignore feminism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People are confused because it doesn’t map neatly along partisan lines, but that’s because misogyny is so pervasive, not because it isn’t political.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That got me thinking, so I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/markstoneman.com/post/3lzo6n5jgsc26">responded</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bridge too far for people who want to naturalize gender norms, and we seem to be falling deeper into that territory at the moment. Ironically, the right is trying to get us there by shoring up cultural norms and denaturalizing non-heteronormative people.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To the extent that people don&rsquo;t question such rhetoric, it is a pretty effective exercise of rhetorical power, that is, reactionary rhetorical violence. Little wonder that gender studies are presented as a threat.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll use a human-readable &ldquo;crossposted from &hellip;&rdquo; statement and link, but I can also place this information inside a JSON-LD script for search engines to parse. The best part: I can put this in the body of a blog post.</p>

I obtained the above through much back-and-forth with GPT-5 mini, and that LLM contradicted itself in different sessions. The schema.org has a validator.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Stories about the politics and business of media have got me thinking about my streaming choices.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still annoyed at Peacock&rsquo;s unannounced introduction of ads to the plan I had. I liked a few of their shows, which made their cheapest paid plan for ad-free viewing worth it. Now the cheapest paid plan only gets you limited shows and heaps of ads.</p>
<p>To get what I had for $6.99 and then $7.99, I would have to pay $16.99 per month. That&rsquo;s a 143.1% increase since 2022. Or a mere 112.6% increase over the $7.99 I was paying when they threw up the ads and I cancelled.</p>
<p>Paramount&rsquo;s value proposition is going to change for me too because of Colbert&rsquo;s departure in the spring. The economics of late night talk shows might be growing against them, but I&rsquo;m one of those people who is not interested in most of the other stuff they stream. Colbert was why I signed up in the first place.</p>
<p>I dropped Netflix after they began insisting that a household had to exist in the same location, whereas real families often live in different locations. Take my <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2023/08/25/sign-of-life.html">eldercare situation</a>, for example. Their programming had already begun to feel bland, like so much processed food.</p>
<p>HBO Max still offers value, but the people who bought Paramount are making eyes at it too, I&rsquo;ve read. Given the venality and ideological goals of the current administration, owning blatantly oversized shares of the American media market will not be a problem for the FCC.</p>
<p>There is PBS Passport, an affordable option that will probably have to get more expensive, given the Corporation for Public Broadcasting&rsquo;s defunding. I&rsquo;m optimistic that public radio and television will survive, but I&rsquo;m not sure they will be readily available in less prosperous, more rural ares, which are already facing the loss of other services.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably do more of what I did when streaming services were less widespread: shop for shows à la carte. That&rsquo;s how I watched The Daily Show because I was damned if I was going to pay for cable programming I didn&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>I began this kind of streaming around the time that TV disappeared from the airwaves where I lived. Yes, we got our digital converter, for free I think, because broadcast TV was supposed to remain readily available. Most signals didn&rsquo;t reach us in our apartment in the nation&rsquo;s capital, so that experiment was short-lived.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Germany&rsquo;s two big public television broadcasters stream a lot of their shows through the ARD Mediathek and the ZDF Mediathek. Some are geo-blocked, depending on licensing arrangements, but much of it is not. News and comedy from a media market that is more or less still functional is a fine thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of other international broadcasters that value public diplomacy enough to make such quality programming in their national language freely available overseas. One exception: There&rsquo;s a joint French-German cultural channel that made the jump to streaming: Arte. Its programming languages seem to be French, German, and English, but not only. The availability of audio and subtitle options depends on the program.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I recently discovered Kanopy, which people can use through their local library. So things aren&rsquo;t all bad. In fact, there is more to be had now than there ever was when I was growing up next to a mountain that blocked ABC, made CBS and PBS inconsistent, but couldn&rsquo;t interfere with NBC&rsquo;s signal from Maine.</p>
<hr>
<p>When my father&rsquo;s dementia began to get the better of him, I introduced streaming to my parents' household because the traditional TV package he had through Spectrum was not only too expensive but also too hard to operate. The TV&rsquo;s Android interface was also impossible, but I found that a Roku streaming stick worked for my mother. With streaming from Paramount and Peacock still affordable, I could play some of my Dad&rsquo;s favorite shows for him, the ones that he could still follow or at least feel at home with.</p>
<p>Some of the streaming apps have grown messier, though, and my Mom is getting older. I notice she almost always turns to PBS these days (including the news), so gradually dropping the other commercial streaming services hasn&rsquo;t been an issue so far.</p>
<p>I used to go crazy in this condo because my father always had the TV on, and it was usually loud. He let me turn it down after I assumed the role of caregiver, but it was still always on.</p>
<p>My mother does things differently. She finds that she can process shows better with closed captioning on and the volume off. Now she only uses sound for concerts, ballets, and her church service, which I stream from my computer. The apartment is generally very quiet nowadays.</p>

			 <p>I added two new books to the rotation of things I read to my granddaughter via FaceTime and screen sharing. Nowadays, her screen is in London instead of on Cape Cod. I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;d already developed the habit before she moved. We do it less frequently because of the time difference, but we can easily jump right into a book whenever the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>The first book is <em>The Spark in You</em> by Andrea Pippins (Random House Studio, 2024). It&rsquo;s about a girl in Brazil, but it is told in the second person, just as the title suggests. I loved talking about the spark in my granddaughter this way while she could imagine herself in the colorful images of a girl preparing for carnival and then attending it. The language is poetic, matching the beauty of the illustrations. It is not the kind of book one just reads, though, because the illustrations are rich in detail and the words more sparse. My granddaughter found lots of details to delight in and talk about.</p>

The girl is black, wearing pink glasses and a pink top. There are sparks and stars on her and in the background, and there are carnival decorations."></a>

</div>
<p>The second book is <em>Princess Cupcake Jones and the Missing Tutu</em> by Ylleya Fields, illustrated by Michael LaDuca (Belle Publishing, 2013). When my granddaughter heard this title, she observed that it sounds like a mystery. In this case, the protagonist cannot find the one piece of clothing that she always insists on wearing. As she looks for it, she begins finding other missing things in odd places. This tale is less sparing with words, offering rhymes on every page.</p>

<p>Anke Stoneman sent me some snapshots of a Ukrainian victory garden opposite the Russian embassy in Glover Park a couple weeks ago. She has generously allowed me to share them here.</p>

What is the Polonne Sunflower Garden?' An explanation follows in bullet points."></a>
</div>
<p>A black sign with white text on it explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><u>Why are there Sunflowers here?</u><br>
<u>What is the Polonne Sunflower Garden?</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Sunflowers are the national flower of Ukraine. When the full Russian invasion of Ukraine began, Sunflowers became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance against Russia’s brutal aggression.</li>
<li>These Sunflowers serve as a symbol of Ukraine’s eventual victory against this unprovoked invasion, and the hope for a peaceful, prosperous, and free Ukraine.</li>
<li>The Polonne (pronounced: pole-own-A) Garden has been planted annually by volunteers since the full Russian invasion began in 2022.</li>
<li>This garden is named after the small town in Ukraine that one of the volunteers used to teach in.</li>
<li>Please do not sick, trample or cut the sunflowers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The sunflowers are on private property, so the occupants of the terrorist state's giant Soviet-era compound across the street must coexist with this proud evidence of Putin's folly. They can enjoy it from a bus stop on either side of the street.</p>
<div class="grid grid--2">

A few on the right are more readily visible."></a>
</div>
<p>A bit further down the hill from the garden is a wooden fence painted in the colors of the Ukrainian flag. Affixed to it are drawings of scenes from Ukrainians apparently showing resolve. The ones I can make out include soldiers. One, working at a terminal, says, "I never thought I'd wear this uniform, but this is my Land!"</p>

<p>Another takeaway from this bit of news: I&rsquo;ve been better at ignoring RFK Jr. news than I thought. I imagine most of us are doing this kind of self-care to varying degrees these days. We can&rsquo;t focus on more than we can handle without going berserk or catatonic.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m starting an account on Threads again in a limited way. My handle is <a href="https://www.threads.com/@stoneman.threads">@stoneman.threads</a>, and my profile reads, &ldquo;Was here for the first 15 months, but bailed because of slow Fediverse integration. Back to connect with people I can follow from Mastodon.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll do some cross-posting, too, but differently, unless I connect with real people and not just an algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>
<p>Sept. 13</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Threads is proving to be as full of friction as it was during my first time round. I&rsquo;m also disappointed to see how many accounts do not have Fediverse sharing turned on. If people on Mastodon expressed trepidation about Threads integration into the Fediverse, they needn&rsquo;t have worried. Threads is not trying to sell the idea, probably because they haven&rsquo;t figured out how to integrate fully without ceding control over user behavior. Ironically, I think some Threads users are themselves afraid of their posts being shared into the Fediverse at large.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sept. 15</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve never experienced a social site as non-responsive and as disrespectful of my browser settings as Threads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sept. 16</p>
<ul>
<li>Another example of the unnecessary friction one encounters on Threads: Supposedly Fediverse accounts can be followed from there, but I can&rsquo;t find any, not even those shown in screenshot examples. The <a href="(https://www.threads.com/fediverse_feed)">Fediverse feed</a> does not work for me, either.</li>
<li>Leaving the first time around was the right decision, but I wanted to learn more about its current level of Fediverse integration. Still lacking. I&rsquo;m not even sure I know anyone there anymore.</li>
<li>Still doing this from a web browser. Different browsers. But the iPhone app is just as unhelpful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sept. 23</p>
<p>Still no Fediverse visible.</p>
<p>Also, I forgot to mention my Instagram experience. I had to set up a new account there in order to use Threads. I made it private because I had no intention of using it. Instagram soon claimed that I was violating their terms and conditions and deleted that account. Yet my Threads account still exists.</p>
<p>Is Meta negging ambivalent users? My impression is that they don&rsquo;t care enough to make even their basic systems work. Take that Instagram account. I was following no one, but the system kept following people for me &ndash; not suggesting follows, but actually following them. And I couldn&rsquo;t unfollow them. Only blocking worked.</p>
<p>Sept. 27</p>
<p>If I am unable to see Fediverse accounts and posts from my new Threads account, I think I must call this experiment a failure. Meta&rsquo;s chatbot suggests I disconnect from and reconnect to the Fediverse, but that Threads setting says that I can only reconnect after 30 days, if I do this. One more bit of unhelpful, unnecessary friction from a company that doesn&rsquo;t really trust open systems.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I go back and forth about having my blog feed automatically sent to the Fediverse because I prefer to mediate how my posts appear there. Nonetheless, I&rsquo;ve decided to turn on this automatic Fediverse sharing again, while retaining my manual crossposting. It&rsquo;s possible a few people might prefer this option, so why not? It might also help with search, if my custom Mastodon feed isn&rsquo;t getting pulled in while my blog&rsquo;s Fediverse feed is.</p>
<p>The blog&rsquo;s Fediverse feed is <a href="https://micro.blog/blog@markstoneman.com">@blogfeed@markstoneman.com</a>. My usual Mastodon account is still <a href="https://zirk.us/@markstoneman">@markstoneman@zirk.us</a>. I can be reached either way, but the second gives me more options, including private posts and boosts.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Apple&rsquo;s promotional video, <a href="https://youtu.be/jGztGfRujSE">Introducing Liquid Glass</a>, begins with views inside a glass building. Viewers can delight in the visual effects produced by the different layers of glass as they move through this futuristic space. So far so good, but imagine Apple designers jumping from such vistas to the notion that this aesthetic should translate into a resource-intense environment that is usable, comfortable, even desirable for all users of their products. Yikes!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Apple computers since 1987, when I bought a MacPlus for college. I&rsquo;ve put up with all their many changes, even the ridiculous, because I could reliably get stuff done with them. With my worsening vision, I&rsquo;ve still been able to adapt, but I don&rsquo;t think that will work with the new design. I&rsquo;m also not keen on buying more processing power to produce Apple&rsquo;s new visual effects. I appreciate good, clean design, but this isn&rsquo;t it.</p>
<p>My anger and anxiety about the impending change is fueled by my elder care responsibilities. As Microsoft made my mother&rsquo;s PC less usable and less safe, especially in my hands, I opted to bring her over to my Mac, while making that experience as familiar as possible. For a woman in her upper 80s, she&rsquo;s doing pretty well. Dragging her through Apple&rsquo;s planned changes, though, is a bad idea.</p>
<p>This is a woman who Facebook is also doing its level best to alienate. Only now I&rsquo;ve got her to the point where she can openly complain about the AI she notices there. Earlier, she would feel embarrassed by her diminishing abilities to use her computer. I told her the problem was with the design changes, not her. I told her about Meta&rsquo;s algorithm, too. She&rsquo;s come to accept this point of view and again be reasonably comfortable doing the things she wants.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also come to enjoy an iPad. I initially got one for her to view photos on, but she&rsquo;s all over solitaire and jigsaw puzzles. I do not plan to let Apple ruin this progress with their thoughtless design decisions and inadequate attention to accessibility needs.</p>
<p>If Apple&rsquo;s design decisions affected only me, I could install Linux Mint when my current MacOS slows down. But I&rsquo;d have to know that system a lot better before I could feel confident about making it usable for Mom.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://markstoneman.com/2025/09/09/shared-notes-header-image-and.html">Shared Notes: Header Image and Avatar Formatting Fix</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://markstoneman.com/2025/09/09/shared-notes-header-image-and.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-09-09 00:07:48 -0400">Sep 9, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The previous CSS for my header image and avatar quit working as expected, but I&rsquo;ve got a fix.</p>
<p>The avatar had changed its size, lost its border, become square, and moved to a different part of the header. I don&rsquo;t know if this happened because I added <a href="https://microformats.io/">microformat</a> classes to my HTML or if the problem lay elsewhere. In any case, here is the revised version of <code>layouts/partials/microhook-profile-photo.html</code> with classes set for my <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Microformats">h-card</a>. These classes contain semantic information about what a given thing is, whereas the normal CSS classes style what we post.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;a class=&quot;u-url u-uid&quot; href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;avatar-container&quot;&gt;
   		&lt;img class=&quot;profile_photo u-photo&quot; src=&quot;https://markstoneman.com/uploads/2025/cant-happen-here-avatar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mark Stoneman's Avatar&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre><p>It seems my original round avatar was working because <a href="/2025/08/14/shared-notes-additional-tiny-theme.html#avatar-and-header">my setup</a> just assumed something that is in most Micro.blog set-ups. The avatars are round and have a specified size. My HTML had specified the avatar size, but apparently that was no longer working. My CSS now specifies the size and roundness explicitly. See the lines <code>border-radius: 50%; width: 120px; height: 120px;</code> near the bottom of the following declaration block:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>.profile_photo {
    border: 3px solid #555;
    position: absolute;
    bottom: -10px;
    left: 10px;
    z-index: 1;
	border-radius: 50%;
	width: 120px;
    height: 120px;
    object-fit: cover;
}
</code></pre><p>Finally, things can get weird if the big profile image below the avatar is not sized properly. Now the declaration includes a new property and value at the bottom (<code>object-fit: cover;</code>). This line specifies how the image of Nazi book burners should behave if it is not the exact size that my blog theme expects. It should cover the area required without stretching or otherwise distorting its aspect ratio.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Much has happened since Twitter&rsquo;s untimely death, so I thought I&rsquo;d revisit my current setup for the social web.</p>
<h3 id="mastodon">Mastodon</h3>
<p>Since my <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/" rel="nofollow">Ivory</a> subscription was coming up for renewal, I poked around for alternatives that might work for me now. I ended up keeping Ivory for iOS/iPadOS, but I gave up the MacOS version because I don&rsquo;t use that enough to justify the extra cost. Moreover, I found an excellent web client called <a href="https://phanpy.social/" rel="nofollow">Planpy</a>. It works on all devices, but it feels good on my desktop. (Mastodon&rsquo;s official site does not feel good.)</p>
<h3 id="bluesky">Bluesky</h3>
<p>The official app is only formatted for the phone. I&rsquo;ve quit using it on my iPad because the experience is subpar. None of the third-party options I&rsquo;ve tried work as well as the website, so I stick with the website. There are new web clients, but I haven&rsquo;t felt the need to go looking yet.</p>
<h3 id="interoperability">Interoperability</h3>
<p>There are tools now to bridge a Mastodon account to Bluesky and vise versa; however, there are people on each platform who don&rsquo;t enable bridging. To follow and interact on both platforms, I still need separate accounts. Fortunately, the conversations do not always overlap. I also don&rsquo;t worry about becoming overwhelmed because I do not even try to keep up. Instead, I dip into each place the way I would to a coffee shop or pub filled with people I know. I go, I socialize, I leave.</p>
<h3 id="posse">POSSE</h3>
<p>To distribute posts from my blog to Mastodon and Bluesky, I use one of three tools, depending on their length and feature set.</p>
<p>Micro.blog, my blog host, offers cross-posting automation. This is perfectly adequate for many, but I prefer a little more control over what is shared and how. Micro.blog also has a crossposting tool for individual blog posts. This lets one see and edit a post before clicking send. I find this option especially good for text-only micro-posts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still using the iOS/iPadOS app <a href="/2023/09/19/juggling-social-media.html#linky-2023">Linky</a> for crossposting as well, especially if I want to generate a text shot with alt text.</p>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;ve got a new system for sharing links from this site. See <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2025/09/06/using-microblog-and-a-different.html">Using Micro.blog and a Different Domain to Create Custom, Privacy-Friendy Short Links</a>.</p>
<h3 id="blogging">Blogging</h3>
<p>Where Markdown will work, that&rsquo;s the markup I use. Fortunately, Markdown will also process HTML, which I sometimes need.</p>
<p>Micro.blog offers serviceable apps for MacOS, iOS, and iPadOS, but I prefer its web app. That said, I tend to use these tools to edit text that I&rsquo;ve already posted, to manage categories, and to manage other aspects of the blog.</p>
<p>With iOS and iPadOS, the fastest way for me to compose posts and upload them to Micro.blog is with <a href="https://getdrafts.com/" rel="nofollow">Drafts.app</a>. This tool also works on MacOS, but its user interface behaves in unexpected ways in that environment.</p>
<p>On MacOS, I&rsquo;ve gone back to an old favorite, <a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit/" rel="nofollow">MarsEdit</a>. If I want more editing power, I use the app&rsquo;s &ldquo;Edit with <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html" rel="nofollow">BBEdit</a>&rdquo; command, take care of business in that editor, maybe preview the post with <a href="https://marked2app.com/" rel="nofollow">Marked</a>, and then return to MarsEdit.</p>
<p>I have tried to use <a href="https://ulysses.app/" rel="nofollow">Ulysses</a> on iPadOS and MacOS, but it feels clunky nowadays. I used it more while editing academic group blogs because it quickly converts Word documents without requiring a separate <a href="https://pandoc.org/" rel="nofollow">Pandoc</a> installation on the Mac. That matters, because Pandoc is a terminal application.</p>
<h3 id="following-blogs">Following Blogs</h3>
<p>For <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-rss-feed-readers/">RSS feeds</a>, I still use <a href="https://netnewswire.com/" rel="nofollow">NetNewsWire</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Since the ruination of Twitter and of Meta&rsquo;s various platforms, I have started following a simplified IndieWeb approach to blogging and social media called <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE" rel="nofollow">POSSE</a>. I first post on my <a href="/">blog</a>. I do so even for the kind of short posts that Twitter once made famous. Then I share this content to other platforms. In this way, my content, my online identity, and my social connections remain mine, not a maladjusted billionaire&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>With this approach, I could still share content to the big siloed platforms, but I don&rsquo;t because I find their values and user experiences intolerable. Currently, I crosspost only to <a href="https://zirk.us/@markstoneman/">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/markstoneman.com">Bluesky</a>.</p>
<p>To make the origin of my cross-posts clearer, going forward, I want to include short links that point to the original posts. These links should not track anyone, and they should be easy for humans to read. That&rsquo;s why I have decided to create short links manually on the IndieWeb platform Micro.blog, which already hosts my main site.</p>
<p>You will not see these short links on <a rel="me" href="https://stoneman.blog">stoneman.blog</a>, however. That site exists only to manage short links and redirects in the <a rel="me" href="https://micro.blog" rel="nofollow">Micro.blog</a> dashboard. I will then add the short links to my social media cross-posts in a consistent format, probably &ldquo;x-post via stoneman.bog/…&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t plan to create such short links for ephemeral microposts, however. That would be overkill. The same goes for link posts with only minimal commentary from me.</p>

<p>It’s a common refrain that the news industry has failed to come up with a functioning business model in the Internet age, but that’s not entirely true.

<p>Quoted in <cite>Martin Austermuhle, <a href="https://51st.news/dc-residents-fight-ice-trump-takeover/">&ldquo;With cellphone cameras and tip lines, D.C. residents find small ways to fight ICE&rdquo;</a>, <em>The 51st</em>, (Aug. 28, 2025)</cite>.</p>
<p>As its title suggests, the article is about much more than this stark quote. It provides advice and resources for positive steps one can take when faced by a blight of federal agents. It also provides examples.</p>
<p>Have I mentioned that I love the District?</p>
<hr>
<p>By the way, <em>The 51st</em> gets its title from the city&rsquo;s struggle for statehood and civic equality. DC needs to be the 51st state. See <a href="https://dcstatehoodnow.org/">dcstatehoodnow.org</a> to learn about the issue from a human rights perspective.</p>

			 <p>While sorting through a jumble of things my mother has been saving, I ran across a box of index cards (3&quot; x 5&quot;) and small pieces of notepaper that her mother had used for cookie recipes in her later years. I had seen these in her kitchen back in the day, but I took a fresh look and found that she had also used the box for record-keeping.</p>
<p>A card with the heading &ldquo;Total cookies by year&rdquo; captures her output between 1977 and 1985. A second card has a line drawn down the middle with one entry (top-left) for her Christmas cookie ingredient costs in 1981 and another (top-right) for her mince pie filling	costs the same year. The way she formatted this data suggests she had intended to repeat these calculations in subsequent years.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, Grandma used to tell us how many of each kind we could have, whenever she set out a fresh plate of Christmas cookies. I had a vague idea of the scale of her operation, for I had helped occasionally, or at least cleaned out some bowls with a spatula and my tongue. This accounting, on the other hand, surprised me. Not Mom, though. She chuckled and said sure, cookies had been serious business for Grandma.</p>
<p>The seasonal goodies were not just consumed in the home but also went out in parcels to family and friends in other parts of the country. Mom still has early childhood memories linked to rationing in World War Two. Her father, a history and social studies teacher, would not allow her mother to turn to the black market to maintain her usual levels of Christmastime baking. [Correction: Mom reports that during her childhood, most of the cookie packages were delivered in person.]</p>
<p>The apparent decline in numbers over the years covered in the notes that have survived probably relates to her age, but also to the number of kids still at home. (In these times she had her own place, which was attached to ours. Hers was the right side of the red house shown at the bottom of <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2022/07/15/the-old-house.html">this post</a>). I imagine the mortality of people to whom she sent Christmas cards and packages also played a role because she had been the youngest of six children. I certainly remember her exchanging fewer cards over time, though not for lack of effort.</p>
<p>If these cards seem trivial to some, they tell the story of a family role she had learned earlier in life. She lost her father as a child and her mother in adolescence, so she probably learned a good deal from the women in her husband&rsquo;s farming family in Illinois. Doing this accounting at her kitchen table in New Hampshire probably conjured up memories not only of her daughter&rsquo;s large family, who she had joined in 1970, but also earlier memories from her long life of love and loss, laughs and worries. (She was widowed already in the mid-1950s.)</p>
<p>Her old notes&mdash;and the visible chocolate stain on the card with the annual totals&mdash;bring me back to my youth, even if I was overseas for several of the Christmases listed here. Did she mail me any cookies when I was in the army? I can&rsquo;t remember, though I recall the care packages of oatmeal cookies she sent while I was an undergraduate student at Dartmouth College. I think at least one batch of oatmeal cookies made its way to Germany via my APO (Army Post Office) address. They travelled well.</p>
<p>One gets rid of a lot of paper in one&rsquo;s life. That this little box of Grandma&rsquo;s cookie baking notes has survived some twenty-two years since her passing says something about their importance in Mom&rsquo;s memory too. So I will honor them, keep them. Whether my son and granddaughter do the same will be up to them. In any case, my son and his great-grandmother (&ldquo;Oma&rdquo;) were lucky enough to have each other in their lives until he was some twelve years old.</p>

<ol>
<li>Modification of post categories on individual blog posts</li>
<li>Modification of avatar appearance to include a background header image</li>
<li>Host fonts locally (to do)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="post-categories">Post Categories</h3>
<p>I wanted to sort the categories after each post. Since I don&rsquo;t know the Go programming language, I turned to the LLMs on offer on DuckDuckGo.</p>
<p>ChatGPT struggled with the problem and took me around in circles. Then I tried o4-mini, and it solved my problem on the first go.</p>
<p>Each individual post on this blog is produced with the <code>layouts/posts/single.html</code> <a href="https://github.com/MattSLangford/Tiny-Theme-for-Micro.blog/blob/main/layouts/post/single.html">template</a>. It is possible to modify the presentation of the categories by adding a <code>layouts/partials/microhook-categories.html</code> file. But what code from the <code>single.html</code> template to include and how to sort the categories? That is the Go programming language problem that o4-mini solved for me.</p>
<p>Then I added a # before each category term inside the link and <code>&amp;#8196;</code> (for an em space) after each term outside the link.</p>
<p>The resulting code for the micro hook:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{{ with .Params.categories }}
  {{ $cats := sort . }}
  &lt;ul class=&quot;post-tags&quot;&gt;
    {{ range $cats }}
      {{ $term := $.Page.Site.GetPage (printf &quot;/categories/%s&quot; (urlize .)) }}
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;{{ if $term }}{{ $term.RelPermalink }}{{ else }}{{ &quot;/&quot; | relURL }}{{ end }}&quot;&gt;
          #{{ title . }} 
        &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    {{ end }}
  &lt;/ul&gt;
{{ end }}
</code></pre><h3 id="avatar-and-header">Avatar and Header Image</h3>
<p class="callout">See the update <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2025/09/09/shared-notes-header-image-and.html">Shared Notes: Header Image and Avatar Formatting Fix</a>.</p>
<p>I added a header image behind the avatar that Micro.blog themes usually display. To do this, I used Tiny Theme&rsquo;s option for another micro hook: <code>layouts/partials/microhook-profile-photo.html</code>.</p>
<p>Coming from WordPress, I never had to solve such problems from scratch, so I got a little help from the above LLMs. The microhook html:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;avatar-container&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img

			width=&quot;120&quot; 
			height=&quot;120&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre><p>The accompanying CSS, which maintains the theme&rsquo;s responsiveness is as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>.avatar-container {

<p>I still want to tweak the site&rsquo;s fonts to make everything more readable. Thing is, though, not all computers have the same fonts preloaded. Many sites use style sheets that call up specific Google Fonts, which are great. Unfortunately, this practice gives Google some sort of tracking opportunity, which in turn means I would have to add a GDPR notice for European visitors.</p>
<p>What to do? Some helpful people have pointed out that <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/host-fonts-locally/3953">hosting fonts locally</a> on Micro.blog is quite easy. I can use Google Fonts this way legally without the tracking.</p>
<p>Once I do this, I will need to modify the fonts section of this site&rsquo;s <a href="https://markstoneman.com/privacy-notice/">privacy notice</a>.</p>

			 <p>If you want to stay informed about the federalization of DC, 51st.news is a great source. Here&rsquo;s the latest from their local perspective: <a href="https://51st.news/trump-dc-mpd-takeover-what-to-know/">&ldquo;Trump’s D.C. ‘takeover’: What we know so far — and where we’re headed.&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that incendiary right-wing rhetoric about cities is the same everywhere, but DC is in a peculiar position. A city of some 700,000 people, it still has <a href="/2024/11/03/dc-residents-still.html">no representation</a> in Congress. Worse, Congress can interfere with its home rule.</p>
<p>I find it hard to forgive Democrats who never made DC statehood a priority. Maybe this administration&rsquo;s actions will help focus Americans' attention on what should be a national issue. DC Statehood is overdue!</p>

They are wearing black-and-white striped prison garb, and they are all pointing indignantly at a single, smaller, empty cell reserved for what collar criminals."></a></p>
<p class="captions">Cartoon by Art Young in <em>Puck</em>, February 19, 1908, via Library of Congress, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2011647283/">https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2011647283/</a>.</p>
<p>The above cartoon criticized the unequal treatment of criminality in the United States. Ordinary people were locked up for all kinds of small offenses, whereas white-collar crime went unpunished.</p>
<p>The people in the cartoon speaking this criticism represented ordinary men and youth jailed for various petty crimes. The subtitle, &ldquo;The Cry of the Small Crook,&rdquo; makes their status clear. The sign on the small empty cell in the middle reads, &ldquo;For the Incorporated Law Breaker,&rdquo; meaning companies, or rather the men who owned and ran them. But that space was empty, so the inmates demanded, &ldquo;Fill That Cell!&rdquo; They wanted to see the big fish imprisoned, the white-collar crooks. Otherwise, where was the justice?</p>

By now, I know the story of Ukraine&rsquo;s Revolution of Dignity from other material I&rsquo;ve read, watched, and listened to since February 2022, but this film was still a worthwhile experience for me.</p>
<p>Instead of summarizing and analyzing events, it lets them unfold in front of a series of seemingly stationary cameras, with longer intervals from each perspective. This approach permitted me to experience the crowds and the individuals who comprised them viscerally. It made the power of contemporary Ukrainian patriotism palpable.</p>
<p>This force is not an ethnic solidarity but a civic one. It continues to frustrate Putin&rsquo;s murderous ambitions, while demanding democratic accountability from Ukrainians' political leadership. It is what attracts so many foreigners to its cause.</p>

			 <p>YouTube&rsquo;s algorithm churned up an interesting 1944 War Department movie titled &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/FAXgU2IQEWY">The Negro Soldier</a>&rdquo; (40 min). It seems to have been aimed at the African American community, appealing to their patriotism. The first part recounts African American military contributions from the Revolutionary War through World War I, while ignoring contemporary divisions in U.S. society and the history that produced them.</p>
<p>Remaining silent on the ongoing violence against people of color in the United States, the film instead has white supremacy speak through the translated words of Adolf Hitler in <em>Mein Kampf</em>, read by an African American minister to his large, all-Black congregation. If Nazis offered a convenient target toward which to steer the struggle for racial equality, the church setting of the film played to Black respectability, family, community, faith, and dignity.</p>
<p>The military training segments of the film focus primarily on combat roles. The menial labor and service positions to which most were relegated only make a brief appearance in the last five minutes, before images of combat quickly obscure them. The film shows many images of all-Black troop formations without openly discussing segregation. On the other hand, it places individual African American men among their white counterparts in a few shots of the initial processing of new enlistees and of officer training.</p>
<p>The film ends with the hymns &ldquo;Onward Christian Soldiers&rdquo; and &ldquo;Joshua Fought the Battle of Jericho,&rdquo; followed by the final notes of &ldquo;My Country, &lsquo;Tis of Thee.&rdquo; If it is silent on racial inequality and unrealized civil rights in America, the implications of its message were more subversive. How could Black soldiers be expected to fight for freedom overseas but submit to tyranny at home?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

			 <p>The eighties-inspired film &ldquo;Freaky Tales&rdquo; (Lionsgate, 2025) by Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden has heart, style, and gore. The violence is over-the-top, but not unremitting. Besides, most of the blood spills satisfyingly from the bodies of nazi creeps.</p>

It provides insights into Ukrainian cultural and psychological responses to the war, links between past and present generations of Ukrainian cultural producers, and efforts to record war crimes for future accountability. It offers ruminations not only on legal accountability but also on the relationship between memory, narrative, and justice. In this way, her thoughts are about Ukraine, but also about people more generally.</p>

<p>The United States is not a forgotten Elysian island. Our two oceans connect us with the rest of the world; they do not separate us. They are carrying, at this moment, machine tools, automobiles, raw materials, and all manner of manufactured goods to the whole world and they are bringing here other materials, such as rubber, tungsten, and tin, that are absolutely essential to the continuance of production at even its present level. They protect us, still, from armed attack upon our soil, but they do not protect us from assaults upon our economy or upon the public mind. They in no way relieve us of the responsibility of doing everything that a great nation can do to maintain a world order in which the interests of its people, and the values that they cherish, can survive and improve.</p>

			 <p>We in the United States were once on a path of gradual, if uneven reform, expanding human rights protections and equality of opportunity. Achieving these ends came to entail protecting or expanding access to safe drinking water, clean air, nourishing food, reliable health care, and good public education. Of course, we often fell short on these goals, but we understood that they mattered. The question was less whether they were desirable and more about how to achieve them. Or so many of us thought.</p>
<p>Now our federal institutions have been captured by a party of extremists hell-bent on violating human rights and limiting opportunities for all but the most prosperous. The grotesque bill Congress has just passed will help them realize these goals, making a mockery of our best political traditions, not least our Declaration of Independence, now 249 years old. Our elected leaders, many representing heavily gerrymandered districts and most beholden to moneyed interests, have chosen to exacerbate already unprecedented economic inequalities and to limit or eliminate equality of opportunity.</p>
<p>If we do not course correct, if we do not vote these bums out of office and demand or do better ourselves, we can look forward to the end of comity. Instead of gradual, if often bumpy or unsettling change, we&rsquo;ll get brutal, systematic oppression followed eventually by violent, institution-destroying revolution. Imagine something like the French Revolution or the Russian/Bolshevik Revolutions instead of the American Revolution. The last of these, in many respects, sought to defend rights and institutions, if at enormous cost to the people we continued to enslave, expropriate, and drive off the land. By defending and reforming our system of government, our leaders avoided the bloody fate of King Louis XVI, and the country grew, redefining itself to include ever wider circles of people.</p>
<p>Can we return to a path of reform? Or will we allow our leaders to exacerbate our differences to the point where too many conclude that violent revolution is the only way to re-establish liberty and justice for all?</p>

			 <p>I know the U.S. blundering into an attack on Iran is the big story of the moment, but these weird examples of MAGA idolatry caught my eye: bills to rename WMATA to WMAGA, to make their leader&rsquo;s birthday a national holiday, and to print $250 bills with said leader on them (<em>Washington Post</em>, <a href="https://archive.ph/sMZo6">archive.ph…</a>).

<p>Western journalists are … taught to report various interpretations of the facts. The adage that there are two sides to a story makes sense when those who represent each side accept the factuality of the world and interpret the same set of facts. Putin’s strategy of implausible deniability exploited this convention while destroying its basis. He positioned himself as a side of the story while mocking factuality. “I am lying to you openly and we both know it” is not a side of the story. It is a trap.</p>

			 <p>Bong Joon Ho&rsquo;s film &ldquo;Mickey 17&rdquo; (Warner Bros., 2025) is weird, fun, full of heart. As science fiction, it explores human nature and the value or meaning of human life. As dark comedy, it takes on the worship of wealthy, narcissistic leaders and their sycophantic enablers.</p>

<p>The Kremlin’s propagandists are in a joyous mood as they anticipate US disengagement from the Ukraine conflict.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Davis&rsquo;s insights come from her study and translation of prominent Russian-language talk shows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As always, the most accurate assessment of the mood in the Kremlin came not from its robotic public statements, but from its highly-paid propagandists in the TV studios. Since they are regularly briefed by the Kremlin’s handlers on what they can and can’t say, their scripted narratives and carefully crafted discussions offer the best window into the regime’s views and aims.</p>
<p>This was also true after the May 19 telephone conversation between Putin and US President Donald J. Trump about a possible peace deal in Ukraine.…</p>

			 <p>I really enjoyed &ldquo;Red Desert&rdquo; (<em>Il deserto rosso</em>), dir. Michelangelo Antonioni (Italy, 1964), starring Monica Vitti and Richard Harris. It was a visual feast with understated drama. The camera moves slowly, inviting viewers to look at and <em>see</em> the industrial and seaside landscapes, the factory technology and domestic interiors, the refuse and pollution, the faces and postures of individuals, the colors.</p>
<p>Giuliana, the protagonist, is a troubled middle-class woman who was once hospitalized after a largely silenced event that still affects her. The film invites us to try and relate the sounds, smells, and textures of the protagonist&rsquo;s social and physical surroundings to her inner life as the social interactions and dialogs unfold.</p>

			 <p>There is a charming road movie on Arte called &ldquo;The Little Brother&rdquo; (Tajikistan, 1991), made at a particular moment in history, between the Soviet Union&rsquo;s dissolution and the Tajik Civil War. It is about a seventeen-year-old who would like to leave home, but can&rsquo;t because he is responsible for his seven-year-old brother. He wants his father, who lives in the countryside, to take responsibility for the kid once more, but that doesn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>The black-and-white film centers on a trip to their father&rsquo;s place. They get there and back on a small freight train, whose driver takes on the occasional passenger and parcel via a barter system. Viewers get to experience the Tajik landscape and moments of rural life from the moving train. Sometimes the train stops, affording encounters with other people. The accompanying soundtrack is fantastic.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been streaming the Franco-Belgian detective series &ldquo;Astrid et Raphaëlle&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;Astrid&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bright Minds&rdquo;) on PBS, and I&rsquo;m really enjoying it. The autistic Astrid is a compelling character, and Sara Mortensen plays her with love and respect. Granted, I know too little about autism, but I find the show&rsquo;s effort to integrate other members of Astrid&rsquo;s evening autistic discussion group helps to round out her character. Then we get to see people with diverse jobs, not to mention varying experiences and abilities vis-à-vis interactions with the neurotypical. Occasional flashbacks to her childhood and youth help too. In the end, though, the series is still a detective show. The police archivist Astrid, solves crimes with a detective who is unafraid to follow leads uncovered by Astrid that her male colleagues would prefer to ignore: Raphaëlle (Comandante Coste), played by Lola Dewaere.</p>

I&rsquo;m usually not attracted to this subject on screen, but I found &ldquo;One Life,&rdquo; dir. James Hawes (Bleeker Street, 2024), both absorbing and affecting. Much of its poignance comes from its shifts between an old man in the late 1980s and his memories of the late 1930s. Anthony Hopkins, who must have been 85 or 86 when he played the lead, is brilliant.</p>

			 <p>A strange thought has been bouncing around in my head lately. If the current administration gets its way regarding how the various departments and agencies are run, even whether or not money appropriated by Congress for them is spent in the first place, that could do more than simply create a governance and democracy problem for the country. Presidential overreach and malfeasance could force Congress to adopt radically different solutions to the national problems we want and need it to address.</p>
<p>Most dramatically, it could consider establishing administrative bodies responsible directly to it, not to the executive branch. Assuming the United States survived whatever the interim brought, the Trump–MAGA–DOGE approach to politics and rule could eventually lead the way to a more parliamentary form of government that limited the president&rsquo;s role to the things specifically enumerated in the Constitution. The Necessary and Proper Clause speaks to Congress, after all, not the executive.</p>
<p>This idea still sounds outlandish to me, mainly because I don&rsquo;t see the administration getting away with its unitary executive theory. If it does, however, then Congress would have to start thinking hard about what is necessary and proper, even removing agencies and departments from the executive branch. Or it could starve these institutions of funds and set up its own. Trump and DOGE have already done a lot of work to make this last option possible.</p>
<p>The president would still have his plenary powers to appoint major officials with the consent of the Senate, but Congress would be under no obligation to fund this cabinet beyond whatever it deemed prudent. Over time, Congress might find it necessary and appropriate to appoint officials from within its own ranks with duties that resemble those of a prime minister and that legislator&rsquo;s cabinet. If the U.S. president has too much power and can&rsquo;t be trusted to exercise it with prudent restraint, why shouldn&rsquo;t Congress begin governing in a way that might lead in this direction?</p>
<p>Parliamentary government might not be the specific goal, but reining in an out-of-control executive certainly needs to be. The result could then well turn out to be a place not unlike where monarchical misrule led in Britain. If the Supreme Court oversteps in order to defend an authoritarian executive, Congress could seek a remedy there as well, changing its size and structure, for example. In short, the extreme degree of power that the Trump administration is trying to assert need not end in the direction they seek or in the pre-MAGA status quo either.</p>
<p>Of course, the nation itself is currently too divided for such sweeping legislation, which would require veto-proof majorities, at least initially. Nonetheless, state initiatives to require run-off elections or weighted voting could yield legislators with more nuanced views and the desire and ability to work for their constituents instead of for a tyrant.</p>

			 <p>Timothy Snyder summing up Russia&rsquo;s relationship to NATO from 1999 to 2010:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The eastward enlargement of NATO in 1999 was not presented by Putin as a threat. Instead, he tried to recruit the United States or NATO to cooperate with Russia to address what he saw as common security problems. After the United States was attacked by Islamist terrorists in 2001, Putin offered to cooperate with NATO in territories that bordered Russia. Putin did not present the EU enlargement of 2004 as a threat. On the contrary, he spoke favorably that year of future EU membership for Ukraine. In 2008, Putin attended the NATO summit in Bucharest. In 2009, Medvedev allowed American aircraft to fly over Russia to supply troops in Afghanistan. In 2010, Russia’s ambassador to NATO, the radical nationalist Dmitry Rogozin, expressed his concern that NATO would leave Afghanistan. Rogozin complained of NATO’s lack of fighting spirit, its “mood of capitulation.” He wanted NATO troops at Russia’s border.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I recently watched &ldquo;Nothing but the Truth&rdquo; and found it to be engaging because of how rooted it is in its time, even as the issues it treats are much more broadly relevant. At its heart is the freedom of the press versus the federal government&rsquo;s powers of coercion in ostensible national security matters. Womanhood and especially motherhood are also important to the story, with mainstream gender norms employed to help viewers relate to (or feel no sympathy for) the woman who the government attempts to coerce. The film is a work of fiction, but its author, Rod Lurie, draws on real events for its initial premise.</p>
<p>During the movie&rsquo;s first ten or twenty minutes, I got nostalgic vibes because there is a news-making national newspaper in DC that hasn&rsquo;t been corrupted by a billionaire, a newspaper whose print distribution still matters. There is an FBI that follows the law, and reporters who think that officials lying is newsworthy, even if short attention spans run counter to this belief. The DC location, regardless of where it was actually filmed, was also familiar because of the occasional overlap between work life and home life, even if the filmmakers restricted that overlap to the two main women characters, a journalist and an outed spy.</p>
<p>As the film went on, I was reminded of how out-of-control the federal government can get when pursuing an administration&rsquo;s aims because the judiciary typically defers to the executive branch on national security matters. The movie shows the U.S. government trying to coerce a reporter to give up her source: it jails her for contempt during a grand jury investigation. Her loss of liberty lasts for nearly a year before there is even a court decision on the specific issues involved. Images of the reporter being transported in leg chains still resonate today. The CIA adds a further low by threatening its own outed agent, reminding her about her upcoming custody hearing.</p>
<p>Since the journalist and the outed spy are both moms, the film connects the two on a personal level by situating their daughters in the same school. The women both volunteer in the school, but don&rsquo;t know each other personally in the beginning, although the journalist knows the other woman&rsquo;s child because of her particular volunteer duties. (If any fathers volunteer, it doesn&rsquo;t come up.) Why is motherhood relevant to the plot? The jailed and then imprisoned journalist pays a high personal cost, being unable to see her young son and probably losing her husband. At the same time, this personal cost can be interpreted by some viewers as her putting a principle ahead of her duty as a mother.</p>
<p>At the very end of the movie, we see that the journalist&rsquo;s initial unintentional source (before she began her actual reporting) had been her son&rsquo;s classmate, the daughter of the outed CIA agent. This makes her principled stand for freedom of the press also about protecting a child. Perhaps, for some people, this lets her off the hook for leaving her own son without a mother for so long. Unfortunately, it also almost overshadows the constitutional issues behind her refusal to be coerced by the U.S. government. Or is that the point? Is this another example of the personal manifesting as political?</p>

I remember enjoying it once or twice before, and I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed this time either. The movie offers good actors, believable and often likable characters, and a gripping tale centered around a dangerous air mail and air freight business connecting a small South American port to remote areas in the mountains with small aircraft and harrowing flight conditions.</p>

I enjoyed the pre-Code film "Ladies They Talk About" (Warner Bros., 1933), starring Barbara Stanwyck. This fast-paced drama features a bank robbery, a revivalist with a radio program, and an interesting portrayal of inmates in a women's ward at San Quentin State Prison. The film also offers sex appeal and comic relief.

Source: "'Bombs Over Us': Prophetic Drawings by a German Artist," <em>Life</em>, September 11, 1939, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=8EEEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&rview=1&pg=PA26#v=twopage&q&f=true" rel="nofollow">pp. 27--28</a>, via "a book … recently published in Germany," presumably <em>Das Theo Matejko-Buch: Zeichnungen als Aufzeichnungen aus zweieinhalb Jahrzehnten</em> (Berlin: Kommodore-Verlag, 1938).
</p>
</div>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
This drawing imagining an air war coming to Berlin was one of a series that Theo Matejko conceived before Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland. It seems to convey antiwar sentiment, but the artist supported the Nazi regime, and he regularly contributed to the propaganda magazine, _Die Wehrmacht_. Given this context, his drawing and the following public explanation might be understood as projection instead. 
<blockquote>
<p>An idea which came to me years ago with unholy force and persistence was the image of an air attack over a big city in some future war. I saw in this dreadful vision the merciless heavens pouring destruction upon peaceful people.… I offer these pictures in the deep and sincere hope that these nightmare visions may never become a reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The drawing doesn&rsquo;t capture anywhere near the reality, but it offers up two powerful national symbols, the Brandenburg Gate and German motherhood. The choice of the latter was an effective way to underline the indiscriminate nature of this kind of warfare while portraying the Germans as innocent victims.</p>

			 <p>I distracted myself from contemporary authoritarianism with the wonderful 1954 Italian film &ldquo;Chronicle of Poor Lovers&rdquo; (<em>Cronache di poveri amanti</em>). It takes place in Florence in the mid 1920s and focuses on the lives of people in the Via del Corno. Everybody seems to know everyone else&rsquo;s business in this street, and life seems pretty normal, even good, despite material privations. But there are also the whispers and occasional off-key tones of a few fascists. Then comes a brutal beating and later the work of a death squad, with individual residents among the murderers and the murdered. The film&rsquo;s title references the young couples that are broken up and formed in the course of this adversity.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;NEXT! From the Cradle to the Mill&rdquo;</strong> Cartoon by Art Young for <em>Puck</em>, April 10, 1912, via Library of Congress, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2011649137/">https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2011649137/</a>.</p>
<p>Note the big shadowy black ghoul labeled &ldquo;NECESSITY&rdquo; leading a young girl out of a dark, impoverished room toward a factory on the right, where two other children are facing a sign at the entrance that reads, &ldquo;Machinery Operated by Children&rdquo; and &ldquo;MEN NEED NOT APPLY.&rdquo; The image of the little girl clutching her doll as she is forced to leave behind her book, paper, toys, and other small items on the floor usually a part of childhood flourishing makes this brutal uprooting from her home appear unnatural.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the preference of the factory for cheaper children over more expensive men characterizes the practice of child labor as a vicious circle. If men are not welcome at the factory, if the lifeless woman at the table is unemployed, and if the children are not in school, the family will not be able to improve its lot, no matter how hard the children toil. This point is underlined by the cartoon&rsquo;s subtitle, &ldquo;From the Cradle to the Mill,&rdquo; a play on the common phrase, &ldquo;from the cradle to the grave.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>The pro-Kremlin media personality Tigran Keosayan has been in <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/01/09/rt-chief-simonyan-says-husband-in-coma-after-undergoing-clinical-death-a87538">a coma</a> since late December. Recently, his grief-stricken wife, RT chief Margarita Simonyan, pondered going to front, if he dies (<a href="https://youtu.be/q4QMSVaXA2g">youtu.be…</a>). I&rsquo;ve never heard Simonyan say anything that wasn&rsquo;t calculated, so this line made me scratch my head a little. Simonyan is still all-in on the &ldquo;special military operation,&rdquo; of course, but it is strange to hear her death wish expressed this way.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t her words come close to admitting what Putin&rsquo;s soldiers need when headed to the front? I&rsquo;m thinking of the Russian &ldquo;meat assaults&rdquo; and their use of soldiers to fire at their own, should they dare not advance or even retreat. Still, Simonyan&rsquo;s words lean on such a common literary trope that they needn&rsquo;t be seen as destabilizing. If there is one thing about Simonyan we can still be sure of, she is an expert <a href="https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2023/10/11/mastering-margarita-en">information warrior</a>.</p>

<p>There would be no security for any except that which each one of us could provide for himself.</p>

			 <p>In a 14-minute explainer, Anders Puck Nielsen discusses how &ldquo;NATO has missed the drone revolution&rdquo; <a href="https://youtu.be/gZL1KzV54Cw">youtu.be…</a>. The R word is thrown around far too easily in military studies, just as it is in tech; however, Nielsen&rsquo;s argument is no mere cliché. Drones don&rsquo;t just supplement other military hardware. In the large quantities in which they now appear, they change the very nature of battle. Wars of movement are once again giving way to wars of attrition, albeit in new ways.</p>
<p>See also the short piece by Valerii Zaluzhnyi that Nielsen talks about in his video: &ldquo;How drones, data, and AI transformed our military—and why the US must follow suit,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2025/04/how-drones-data-and-ai-transformed-our-militaryand-why-us-must-follow-suit/404444/">defenseone.com…</a>.</p>
<p>It seems western armies cannot afford any arrogance vis-à-vis Ukraine. They need to learn from that countryʼs armed forces, just as the latter will continue to benefit from our armaments.</p>

I introduced this book to my granddaughter yesterday (via video chat), and she adores it. Apparently it once made an impression on my son, too, because he said it had been his favorite. It's a simple story in which Harold takes a walk, creating the world as he goes with a big purple crayon.

			 <p>Last Tuesday&rsquo;s ballot for the local election in Conway, NH, seemed extraordinarily long to me. The many budget and development questions (&ldquo;warrants&rdquo;) would probably have been decided at town meetings in earlier days. Maybe they still are in smaller NH towns, as they were in Tamworth when I was growing up. Anyway, today I noticed that the research I did for the election and the half hour or more it took me to fill out my ballot have had a positive effect on me. Driving around town with my elderly mother today, I realized that I knew some things about the direction of the town&rsquo;s development and that I actually cared. It seems I&rsquo;m growing more connected to this place in these times.</p>
<p>This shifting personal orientation is no small thing because I&rsquo;ve felt relatively isolated here since coming up from DC for eldercare in late 2021. Hanging out in indoor spaces where I might meet people is limited by my awareness of the health risks that such activities entail for my mother. This circumstance also limits word-of-mouth news about local goings on. It doesn&rsquo;t help that the days of bulletin boards and multiple local and regional newspapers are long gone. I&rsquo;m told there&rsquo;s local information on Facebook, but I wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> desperate.</p>
<p>Last week, I finally subscribed to the online version of the only remaining local paper in order to prepare for the election. I took the plunge after talking with a few people at the protest on April 5th, my first in this town. I think this bit of personal agency and local involvement is doing me good, especially in these times. The paper prints letters, so maybe it&rsquo;s high time I wrote one of those up here too. The last time I did that was for the International Herald Tribune in the early 1990s while living in Germany.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m in the second of two miniseries called &ldquo;A Young Doctor&rsquo;s Notebook and Other Stories&rdquo; (Sky Arts, 2012-13). It is based on work by Mikhail Bulgakov and is set mainly in rural Russia in 1917–18, with flashforwards to 1934–35.</p>
<p>Or is it set in Moscow in 1934–35 with flashbacks? Either way, Jon Hamm plays the lead in the 1930s and Daniel Radcliffe plays the same character in the 1910s. Hamm&rsquo;s character is also present in the 1910s as a kind of morphine-induced hallucination who talks to his younger self.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying this dark comedy, but be advised that it has drug addiction, gore, and other bodily fluids. The Hobbesian characterization of life as nasty, brutish, and short applies.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m so excited. I just read Dr. Seuss&rsquo;s <em>One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish</em> to my granddaughter in another state using the MacOS Books and FaceTime apps. Since we&rsquo;d already read this on a couch together a few times, she sometimes explained a page to her father before I read it to her. Or she got excited and spoke lines before or with me.</p>
<p>At this young age (preschool), it helped that a parent was sitting next to her. That took care of the cuddle element that one usually gets when being read to. It also helped reduce the distraction of background voices in the house.</p>
<p>I did this on my desktop using <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-apps-in-split-view-mchl4fbe2921/mac">split view</a>, devoting a small part of the screen to her face. On the other end, they used an iPad to follow along. They saw the book open to two pages along with my face because I was sharing my whole screen in FaceTime.</p>

			 <p>I saw the first hour of Fritz Lang&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hangmen Also Die&rdquo; (United Artists, 1943) tonight. The story, inspired by Reinhard Heydrich&rsquo;s shooting in Prague in 1942, was a collaboration between Lang and Bertolt Brecht. The film is good, but 135 minutes of wartime stereotypes is a lot.</p>

			 <p>I enjoyed &ldquo;The Cape Town Affair&rdquo; (South Africa, 1967), starring Claire Trevor, James Brolin, and Jacquelin Bisset. I&rsquo;ve never been to that part of the world, so seeing the city in this period was doubly interesting. The level of <a href="https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/cape-town-segregated-city">segregation</a>, however, stood out, as did the unsettling naturalness of its portrayal.</p>
<p>The film is a spy story involving mainly white people of different social classes and ages. The one exception is the Communist ringleader, who appears only two or three times and presents as East Asian. This world of espionage inadvertently becomes entangled with less reputable characters who live by their own, less unsavory codes.</p>
<p>The film is a remake of the New York City noir &ldquo;Pickup on South Street&rdquo; (USA, 1953), which I haven&rsquo;t seen.</p>

			 <p>The last time I saw &ldquo;Three Days of the Condor,&rdquo; dir. Sydney Pollack (Paramount, 1975), was long enough ago that I didn&rsquo;t get as much out of its mid-seventies paranoia about the CIA as I did this time around. Or maybe it just didn&rsquo;t gnaw away at me like it&rsquo;s doing now. I grew up in a small rural town, but the grit in that movie pervaded a lot of popular television culture. I also heard my fair share of conspiracy-theory talk during my teens. Besides, the CIA was in the news.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not sure what to make of the mentality expressed in this film. It&rsquo;s interesting, in any case, to speculate about how anti-establishment images and paranoia from the period have mapped onto both ends of our political spectrum.</p>

			 <p>This evening I saw &ldquo;Secret Agent,&rdquo; dir. Alfred Hitchcock (UK, 1936). It was a box office hit in its time, but for me it&rsquo;s less compelling than &ldquo;The Thirty-Nine Steps&rdquo; (1936) and &ldquo;The Man Who Knew Too Much&rdquo; (1934). The cinematography and moments of suspense were nonetheless entertaining and characteristically Hitchcock.</p>
<p>Unlike the protagonists in the other two movies, who become involved in espionage by chance and are clearly the good guys, the protagonists in this film play morally ambiguous roles. Their mission is to locate an enemy agent in Switzerland and assassinate him before he can carry British military secrets to the Ottomans. Only the playful, but dark character played by Peter Lorre enjoys the necessary close-up work of killing.</p>
<p>Silhouettes of hanged spies out a train window on the way through enemy territory underline the ultimate personal price during war, if caught. A Swiss hotel and casino serves as a glamorous counterpoint, with social banter, dress, and flirting more in line with the 1930s than 1916. That means viewers are treated to Madeleine Carroll&rsquo;s bare shoulders while she is wrapped in a towel that covers the rest of her body in a scene with two men in full dress.</p>

			 <p>Just watched &ldquo;Berlin Correspondent,&rdquo; dir. Eugene Forde (20th Century Fox, 1942). It&rsquo;s not so much about a reporter as it is about the Gestapo&rsquo;s efforts to uncover his spying and then beat his escapes. Interesting to me were the overt references to euthanasia or &ldquo;mercy killings&rdquo; in the film.</p>
<p>Here, though, the commander of such a facility jokes about Germany soon being &ldquo;100% insanity free&rdquo;&mdash;nice irony for a wartime U.S. audience, but maybe less funny to 21st-century ears. In any case, the quick-thinking American journalist outwits the Gestapo. The tone doesn&rsquo;t feel too far removed from the 1960s TV sitcom, &ldquo;Hogan&rsquo;s Heroes&rdquo; (1965–71).</p>

			 <p>For thievery and spying escapades set in the Blitz, &ldquo;Counter-Espionage&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;The Lone Wolf in Scotland Yard&rdquo;) dir. Edward Dmytryk (Columbia Pictures, 1942), isn&rsquo;t bad. If its light tone, despite its air raids and bombs, seems out of place, it was produced for a wartime public in need of good tales.</p>
<p>By the way, the film has an odd science fiction component to it, though I have no idea how believable it would have been to the audience. First, there were plans for a lethal blue ray contraption (military figures in Berlin spoke of directional rays). Second, the spy ring transmitted information to Berlin with a large device that more or less functioned like a wireless fax. Finally, these people communicated between London and Berlin over the radio by voice.</p>

<p>Our fascination with such fakes doesn&rsquo;t just go back to Photoshop and before that photocopiers. There were plenty of joke postcards in the early twentieth century, many of them agricultural. There were ears of corn as long as hay wagons, onions that took two men to roll up a ramp into a truck or wagon, a Maine potato that filled a whole flatbed rail car, and so on. The jackalope was also popular.</p>

<p>We Germans refuse to believe that people want to be free.… All we&rsquo;re good at is killing, killing, killing! We&rsquo;ve strewn all of Europe with corpses, and from their graves rises up an unquenchable hatred. Hatred… hatred everywhere! That hatred will devour us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words are the subtitle translations of lines spoken in the famous early postwar film, &ldquo;Rome Open City,&rdquo; dir. Roberto Rossellini (Italy, 1945). They issue from the mouth of a drunk German officer to his Gestapo commander, who was sure he could make a staunch Italian partisan talk that same night.</p>
<p>The scene reminds me of assertions by Niccolo Machiavelli in <em>The Prince</em> (1532): It is better to be feared than loved because fear is something the ruler can control. But the ruler should avoid awaking the hatred of his subjects because that emotion could prove fatal to him (chaps. 17 and 19).</p>
<p>For Machiavelli, hatred resulted from a ruler taking the property and women of his subjects. For the drunk officer in &ldquo;Rome Open City,&rdquo; the German masters' attacks on honor, dignity, and human life inspired deep hatred, but the Gestapo officer denied that emotion&rsquo;s power.</p>
<p>In our own time, Putin seems to appreciate the personal danger that he is in. He likely doesn&rsquo;t blame himself for this circumstance, but he knows that his system of rule will continue to demand political assassinations, the ruthless suppression of free speech, and predatory corruption.</p>
<p>His war against Ukraine helps him legitimize his tyranny inside Russia, but he seems incapable of grasping that he will never bend Ukraine itself to his will. No matter how much property he destroys, no matter how many bodies and lives he disfigures or ends, Ukrainians refuse to surrender their personhood, nationhood, and dignity. If anything, Putin has turned this European neighbor into a formidable enemy. The hatred he fuels as he robs Ukrainians of their children and other loved ones cannot be overstated.</p>

			 <p>Timothy Snyder posits an important nexus between our current political moment and how we as a society understand history.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> When communist states proved unable to achieve their Marxist-Leninist ambitions, we did not feel the need to look too closely for an explanation in the histories of these states and their peoples. The communist project didn&rsquo;t succeed because it was wrongheaded. Its failure lay in its problematic view of human development, that is, in its false, teleological philosophy of history.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t see a problem with teleological thinking as such, despite historians' emphasis on provable historical causality over imagined directions that history is somehow destined to take. Instead, we assumed that the failure of their philosophy of history proved that our own was right. The world was on an inexorable path toward mutually reinforcing free trade and free societies. Why sweat the details?</p>
<p>Writing at the beginning of the first Trump administration, Snyder argued the need for a genuine historicization of our world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The politics of inevitability is a self-induced intellectual coma.…</p>
<p>The acceptance of inevitability stilted the way we talked about politics in the twenty-first century. It stifled policy debate and tended to generate party systems where one political party defended the status quo, while the other proposed total negation. We learned to say that there was “no alternative” to the basic order of things…<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our tunnel vision, our focus on everything supposedly going the way it was supposed to, left us complacent. Trump&rsquo;s 2016 election blindsided us, and the contingency of history continues to <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/10/27/its-one-thing.html">punch us in the face</a>.</p>
<p>The enemies of democracy are guided by an equally ahistorical or &ldquo;antihistorical&rdquo; notion of human development. Snyder uses &ldquo;eternity&rdquo; to describe their image of history and politics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like the politics of inevitability, the politics of eternity performs a masquerade of history, though a different one. It is concerned with the past, but in a self-absorbed way, free of any real concern with facts. Its mood is a longing for past moments that never really happened during epochs that were, in fact, disastrous.…<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this view includes enemies and grievances, which can make nostalgia and an antihistorical worldview of unending merit dangerously aggressive. Consider the <a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/lost-cause-the/">Lost Cause</a> interpretation of the American Civil War, the poisonous <a href="https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/stab-in-the-back-myth/">stab-in-the-back myth</a> in Weimar Germany, or the giant <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/putin-historical-russia-soviet-breakup-ukraine/31606186.html">chip on Putin&rsquo;s shoulder</a> left by the USSR&rsquo;s dissolution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the politics of eternity, the seduction by a mythicized past prevents us from thinking about possible futures. The habit of dwelling on victimhood dulls the impulse of self-correction. Since the nation is defined by its inherent virtue rather than by its future potential, politics becomes a discussion of good and evil rather than a discussion of possible solutions to real problems. Since the crisis is permanent, the sense of emergency is always present; planning for the future seems impossible or even disloyal. How can we even think of reform when the enemy is always at the gate?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stakes of such a worldview for our culture and our development are existential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the politics of inevitability is like a coma, the politics of eternity is like hypnosis: We stare at the spinning vortex of cyclical myth until we fall into a trance&mdash;and then we do something shocking at someone else’s orders.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we need, argues Snyder, is to be better grounded in history so that we can understand what was and what is. In resisting the coma and the trance, we might imagine other futures and look for opportunities to shape the way history develops.</p>
<p>Historicizing our world includes applying historical analysis to our immediate past. Snyder&rsquo;s 2018 <em>The Road to Unfreedom</em> considers a period less than a decade old at the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we emerge from inevitability and contend with eternity, a history of disintegration can be a guide to repair.…<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project of this contemporary historian is as urgent as it is ambitious.</p>

<p>Marxism is nothing if not a philosophy of history itself, a scientific description of how and why human societies develop as they do. It also propagates worker consciousness, worker knowledge of their historical role. See, for example, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, <em>The Communist Manifesto</em> (1848). Lenin, impatient to move things along, developed the notion of a cadre of professional revolutionaries. Revolution and communism wouldn&rsquo;t just happen. They had to be wrought from above. See V.

			 <p>The IndieWeb blogging platform Micro.blog recently added an option to use a server in the European Union (Germany) instead of the United States. They began with the <a href="https://www.manton.org/2025/03/19/microblog-adding-european-servers.html">blogs</a> themselves and then added <a href="https://www.manton.org/2025/03/25/microblog-expanding-photo-servers-in.html">images</a> and other files. These changes comport with a broader movement to reduce exposure to services hosted in the United States, especially those dominated by or entangled with big tech, which has shown itself eager to cooperate with the lawless impulses of the Trump administration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if the European option will make much of a practical difference to my particular situation at present. Nonetheless, I&rsquo;ve made the switch because I like the idea of being more mindful about what services I use and where they are hosted. Doing so matters not only in the current political climate but also given big tech&rsquo;s longstanding unethical treatment of user data, a circumstance lent more urgency by their development of LLM-based artificial intelligence.</p>

			 <p>One interesting artifact of 1970s and 1980s CB radio sociability is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QSL_card">QSL card</a>, a printed or hand-drawn confirmation of having been in contact with someone else via radio. Apparently one could collect them or pass them along to someone else as a recommendation.</p>
<p>The cards from CB radio operators that I&rsquo;ve examined among the Newberry Library&rsquo;s digitized collection of <a href="https://collections.newberry.org/C.aspx?VP3=DamView&amp;KW_RID=2KXJ20LKHX0&amp;FR_=1&amp;W=1457&amp;H=777">African American QSL cards</a> seem to have been exchanged in person, presumably somewhere on the road. They used radio lingo, like we do abbreviations for the internet and instant messaging. Often preprinted with applicable check boxes for such exchanges, there was also space for hastily scrawled messages, written the way one might speak over the air without regard to more formal written conventions. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>The Newberry&rsquo;s collection of 52 cards from men and women CB, ham, and shortwave radio operators include a mailing address, always a P.O. Box.</p>
<p><a href="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/166262/2025/c7bde71e32.jpg"><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/166262/2025/c7bde71e32.jpg" width="100%" alt="Front side of a postcard printed with black and red ink. The front of the card uses an official license, KTA-5189, and 'station unit 29'. It features a picture of an African American woman with a large bust and afro leaning on a somewhat dilapidated wooden fence out west, with a cactus off to the side in the background. The card offers two names, CHRISTI LOVE and YELLOW SWAN, and it provides a post office box in Waterloo, Indiana. There is motto at the bottom, 'Between C.B. and my hobby, I never have time for anything else.' The card also provides details of the channels Christi Love uses."></a></p>
<p><a href="https://collections.newberry.org/asset-management/2KXJ8ZSQFQO3E">The card</a> I&rsquo;m sharing here was given to the recipient in person, as you can see from the message on the back. The &ldquo;73&rsquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;88&rsquo;s&rdquo; referenced on the card stem from old Western Union <a href="https://kc5our.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Western-Union-92-codes.pdf">telegram codes</a>, in this case meaning something akin to &ldquo;best regards&rdquo; and &ldquo;love and kisses,&rdquo; with &ldquo;44&rsquo;s&rdquo; referring to prompt replies. The author also used a handwritten <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-code">ten-code</a> on the back to indicate that there had been a clear signal the whole time: &ldquo;you be 10-8 all the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/166262/2025/b414ddd221.jpg"><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/166262/2025/b414ddd221.jpg" width="100%" alt="Backside of a postcard with preprinted and handwritten text.

You [sound] so good, I am glad to talk to you. you be 10-8 all the way. I am so glad, thanks […?…] here my state today."></a></p>
<p>Before running across these cards, I only ever experienced American CB radio culture through television and movies. I did see CBs in Europe when catching rides with truck drivers during my hitchhiking days. In any case, these cards add an entirely new dimension to radio sociability for me.</p>
<p>Given our contemporary reliance on big internet systems, maybe those people who still use these older forms of communication are doing the rest of us a real favor. Maintaining knowledge of such technology&mdash;and a market for it&mdash;could be a real lifesaver one day.</p>

			 <p>I heard the term <em>deadcatting</em> for the first time today.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It means employing a shocking distraction to pull peoples' eyes away from what matters. Why a dead cat? Imagine throwing one on a table at which people are engaged in a heated  discussion. Their focus will be pulled to the cat instead of lingering on whatever difficulty is before them. This <em>dead cat strategy</em> can overlap with scapegoating and the politics of division, as when Trump claimed that Haitian immigrants were eating their neighbors' cats and dogs.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

			 <p>The 30-day partial cease fire that Putin and Trump agreed to is a one-sided joke.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kyivindependent.com/trump-putin-call-russia-agrees-to-30-day-pause-of-energy-infrastructure-strikes/">&ldquo;Trump-Putin call: Russia agrees to 30-day pause of energy infrastructure strikes.&quot;</a> (Kyiv Independent)</li>
</ul>
<p>Russia probably needs relief from strikes on its energy infrastructure more than Ukraine does because the former depends on energy to finance its war. Ukraine, at least, has made it through another winter, when attacks on its energy infrastructure hurt the worst. Moreover, its air defenses seem to be more effective than Russia&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The real kicker, though, are the accompanying demands and threats, which continue to assert Russia&rsquo;s maximalist aim of destroying Ukrainian sovereignty by demanding it do nothing to improve its defense posture. Meanwhile, the White House and Kremlin &ldquo;agreed to set up Russian and American expert groups to &lsquo;resolve the war bilaterally,'&rdquo; i.e., without Ukraine or the rest of Europe. Of course, the Kremlin issued yet another tired threat of &ldquo;escalation.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-demands-to-stop-supplying-military-intelligence-aid-to-ukraine-announces-new-prisoner-swap/">Kremlin demands halt to foreign military aid, intelligence to Ukraine as condition for avoiding war escalation.</a> (Kyiv Independent)</li>
</ul>
<p>Will the White House side with Russia again, despite the Kremlin playing Trump for a fool? It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me, given that Trump has no advisors who will tell him what he needs to hear. I hope I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

			 <p>For a so-called businessman, His Magnificent Bigly Orangeness seems to know precious little about the relative predictability that businesses need in order to make informed decisions. For reality TV or the kind of show Jerry Springer had, however, constant chaos can increase viewership. Orangeman&rsquo;s style of television was successful because many people enjoyed his schtick.</p>
<p>The move from television to politics was natural. As long as he didn&rsquo;t have to know things or govern, he could apply the same loud-mouthed, made-for-TV nonsense to the United States as a whole. NBC having already marketed him for years, it was easy to get his fans to jump on this new bandwagon.</p>
<p>His politics of unrelenting chaos, finger-pointing, scapegoating, grievance rhetoric, and race-baiting has brought him to the White House twice. But achieving such success is not the same as getting the nation&rsquo;s work done. His style of politics is no way to conduct international relations or basic governance at home.</p>
<p>I know that he likes to have all cameras on him, but the United States has a wealth of experienced and talented people who could do the necessary work and give him all the credit. I&rsquo;m sure they could also help him produce &ldquo;must watch&rdquo; TV moments with himself at the center.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no people with adequate knowledge and experience are in his administration. He has purposefully insulated himself from alternative viewpoints, while cowardly and venal Republican senators enable the practice. In this way, we get a common-law presidential spouse, First Gentleman Felonious Husk, in addition to the president&rsquo;s legal spouse, First Lady Trump.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Russia&rsquo;s war against Ukraine has been marked by an effort to avoid universal (manhood) conscription. It is the regime&rsquo;s war, so to speak (a &ldquo;special military operation&rdquo;), not a people&rsquo;s war.</p>
<p>On the other side, Ukraine uses conscription because it is indeed a national or people&rsquo;s war for them. It is a fight for their very survival. Russia is even treating each and every Ukrainian as a &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; target. But even Ukraine has avoided calling up younger men. It seems they lack the political consensus to do so.</p>
<p>I thought about this again when Vance made his historically ignorant accusation in the White House that Ukraine&rsquo;s military manpower situation was so bad that they had to force men into the army. It&rsquo;s as if Vance had never heard of the draft in the United States. Or he doesn&rsquo;t know that &ldquo;conscription&rdquo; means &ldquo;draft&rdquo; in modern U.S. military history. Regardless, conscription is what countries do when they believe the national stakes are extremely high. If Vance had read any histories of war over the past couple centuries, he would know this.</p>
<p>One notable exception to conscription in national or total wars: Britain tried to fight the First World War with only volunteers, and they succeeded up to a point. By 1916, however, they had to institute conscription as well (&ldquo;Military Service&rdquo;). Little wonder. That war in particular had a ravenous appetite for men.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the issue of conscription for another reason. Western leaders have spent the first three years of the Russo-Ukrainian War trying to prevent average citizens from feeling any pain. They&rsquo;ve avoided spending the money necessary to mobilize our defense industries sufficiently to support a Ukrainian victory and form a credible deterrent to Russia (and China).</p>
<p>This avoidance points to one or all of the following developments in democracies and authoritarian kleptocracies alike:</p>
<ol>
<li>The relationship between nation states and their peoples has changed substantially. Are people less patriotic? Maybe they are less willing to follow their leaders&rsquo;s calls to war?</li>
<li>Do nation states care more about consent than they used to? Or have they grown more timid? Perhaps they are acting on an everyday awareness of popular opinion gleaned from social media, for example.</li>
<li>Are contemporary leaders more likely to follow popular opinion than lead it? Even Putin and Trump are hardly leading, unless one thinks gaslighting their nations and the world counts.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have no answer here. It just feels like the post–Cold War era of increasingly volunteer armies and neoliberal economic policies is being challenged by the demands of Mars and his acolytes, even if few have come to accept the consequences of this shift.</p>

<h3 id="your-size-and-weight-dont-count-in-my-style-of-wrestling">&ldquo;Your size and weight don&rsquo;t count in my style of wrestling.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>This was the last in a series of six postcards that marked the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I chose it because its caption speaks to Russia&rsquo;s current war against Ukraine. The Russian Bear&rsquo;s smaller opponent says, &ldquo;Your size and weight don&rsquo;t count in my style of wrestling.&rdquo; Unlike today, Japan, not Russia, began this war with a surprise attack. Still, observers assumed the Russian Bear would prevail. It did not, and the Tsar faced revolution at home. The bigger the beast, the harder the fall.</p>
<p>The war in Ukraine is different, but there, too, Russia is running up against the limits of its strength. It is facing economic collapse and worse. Rather strangely, the new-old U.S. president wants to throw his weight behind the corrupt old Russian Bear. Doing so will cost more Ukrainian lives and the United States its reputation and influence. But Ukraine will come up with new ways to stop Russia. Meanwhile, the political cartoonists will continue to do their thing, if not on postcards.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Conclave,&rdquo; dir. Edward Berger (USA/UK, 2024), is one helluva good movie. Made differently, the same story could have yielded a drama, but here it is a thriller, driven by dialog, cinematography, and sound&mdash;with superb use of space, ceremony, and costumes.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Cloak and Dagger,&rdquo; dir. Fritz Lang (Warner Bros., 1946), is good as a thriller and as a war film. Unfortunately, it never develops its initial premise, the race to develop the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Given that the U.S. was the only nuclear power in 1946, emphasizing the transferability of knowledge about weaponized applied nuclear physics would have been politically problematic anyway.</p>
<p>Fighting fascism, however, was a-okay. So were women serving as counterintelligence agents and partisans in this early Atomic Era film. Gary Cooper stars as an American physicist turned agent, who falls for a gun-toting Italian played by Lilli Palmer.</p>

<p>In the powerful image above,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> a biblical passage on the pulpit reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord in the midst of us? No evil can come upon us. Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> … Woe unto them who decree unrighteous decrees … who turn aside the needy from justice, and rob the poor of my people of their rights.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below are church pews full of worshipers. Straight ahead are two church windows and above them a cross in front of a bigger window that is cracking. The walls of the church and a beam are coming down, helped along by falling bombs. Surrounding the cross that the bombs are falling toward are four quadrants that show challenges and injustices of the late 1930s and early 1940s. (If they match up with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, I am unsure how.)</p>
<p>Clockwise from top-left: There is a factory producing something; out front stands a boy whose emaciated ribs and distended stomach are painfully visible. Next, there are buildings almost completely submerged by flood waters; flooded telephone poles are leaning precariously.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> After that is a Black man hanging by his neck from a tree; the seated onlookers are wearing civilian clothes, not Klan robes. Finally, there are sharecroppers bent over, working a field, presumably for less than their bare subsistence requires.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always avoided posting such images, but the history whitewashing of the current administration is making me think differently. This art, at least, is respectful. It depicts the humanity of the victims, unlike the grizzly souvenir postcards circulated by the terrorists.</p>

			 <p>If the FDP doesn&rsquo;t make it back into the Bundestag, and if Scholz is gone, maybe this early election will have been worth it. Much will depend on how much pragmatism the CDU/CSU and the SPD can muster. The only party in the incumbent coalition not to get completely hammered are the capable Greens.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I kicked off the weekend with another movie, &ldquo;Ship of Fools&rdquo; dir. Stanley Kramer (Columbia Pictures, 1965). Set in early 1933, it is based on Katherine Anne Porter&rsquo;s 1962 novel by the same title about a trip on a German liner she took from Veracruz to Bremerhaven by way of Cuba and Spain.</p>
<p>The film covers many topics, including class, race, gender, sex, domestic violence, political and economic oppression, parental authority, migrant labor, deportation, social consciousness, classism. middle age, youth, drug addiction, sex work, Nazis, eugenics, prejudice, extreme poverty, extreme wealth, ambition, success, failure, regret, guilt, love, artifice, authenticity, laughter, self-pity, sorrow, malaise, and joy.</p>
<p>There is also German culture, of course, including different kinds of music, and represented most positively by a Jew. This proud Iron Cross recipient loves the best of his homeland and sees the best in it too, despite obvious prejudice and unsettling portents. Meanwhile, the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Germans sit at the captain&rsquo;s table, a place the captain himself can&rsquo;t bear to frequent, but where a dog is seated among the humans.</p>
<p>A bit soapy in places for my taste, it is nonetheless as topical as ever, perhaps more so. A dwarf closes out the film after their arrival in Germany by anticipating a question on viewers' minds: &ldquo;What has all this to do with us?&rdquo; His answer is &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; even as he seems to mean: &ldquo;Everything, you fools, but you won&rsquo;t grasp it, just as we fools haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Tonight I watched &ldquo;The Iron Curtain,&rdquo; dir. William A. Wellman (Twentieth Century–Fox, 1948).

<h4 id="related-news-from-1948">Related News from 1948</h4>
<p>The excerpt below from a news item in a trade journal uses the term &ldquo;appeasement&rdquo; to describe attempts to block the film&rsquo;s release.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> And it recalls accusations &ldquo;of war-mongering because of alleged anti-Nazi films&rdquo; before the U.S. entry into World War Two. Disinformation campaigns by hostile governments are nothing new, it seems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MPAA Pins Red Label on &ldquo;Curtain&rdquo; Protest</strong></p>
<p>Reaffirming his continued resistance to any attempts to dictate what appears or does not appear on the screen, Eric A. Johnston, MPAA [Motion Picture Association of America] president, has rejected the protest of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship against release of 20th-Fox&rsquo;s forthcoming &ldquo;The Iron Curtain.&rdquo; At the same time Johnston questioned the motives of the National Council and coneluded that &ldquo;the purpose of your organization is to create in this country an atmosphere of appeasement and acceptance of Russia&rsquo;s policy of aggression and expansion.&quot;…</p>
<p>Johnston pointed out … that the issue of free speech in relation to the screen was challenged seven years ago before a Senate committee, when the producers were accused of war-mongering because of alleged anti-Nazi films. &ldquo;Producers then insisted upon and maintained their constitutional right to make films on any subject, free from dictation,&rdquo; Johnston reminded. &ldquo;Their position was vindicated. They stand on that right today, and I back them up.&quot;…</p>

			 <p>These three paintings of one man are titled &ldquo;The Contraband,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Recruit,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Veteran.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="grid grid--3">
<a href="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/166262/2025/a350fe148f.jpeg"><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/166262/2025/a350fe148f.jpeg" width="100%" alt="Description from The Met: 'This work, painted at the close of the Civil War, forms a narrative triptych … of African American military service. In 'The Contraband' … the self-emancipated man appears in a U.S. Army Provost Marshall General office, eager to enlist.' He is raising his hat, and the U.S. flag is visible behind him."></a>
<a href="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/166262/2025/img-0724.jpeg"><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/166262/2025/img-0724.jpeg" width="100%" alt="'The Recruit' depicts the same man as a proud new soldier wearing union blue with a rifle slung over his shoulder."></a>
<a href="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/166262/2025/img-0725.jpeg"><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/166262/2025/img-0725.jpeg" width="100%" alt="In 'The Veteran,' the same man appears on crutches because he is missing his lower left leg. His clothes are civilian, but he's got a Union army cap on. He is saluting."></a>
</div>
<p>The word &ldquo;contraband&rdquo; referred to an enslaved person who had escaped. Given that the term usually indicated illegally imported or exported goods, its dehumanizing quality in the context of someone who has escaped bondage is palpable. Here, however, it stands in contrast to the painting, which shows a man, not a chattel or a caricature.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
The other two paintings see the same figure transformed into a soldier and a veteran. Both of these images underlined the figure&rsquo;s manhood. With time, in fact, military service came to be associated with masculinity and citizenship in an age of people&rsquo;s wars fought in North America and Europe.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>From this point of view, the paintings represent a message not only of self-emancipation through military service but of modern masculine citizenship shortly before the nineteenth amendment was ratified. In the West, this image of manhood and military service reached its high point in World Wars One and Two.</p>

Intersections: three photos of [Ernestine Eckstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernestine_Eckstein) in a 1965 picket line outside the White House protesting Federal discrimination against gay people in civil and military service and their obtaining security clearances.

Another lesbian activist, white, is visible in one photo: [Barbara Gittings](https://markstoneman.com/2025/01/29/so-much-joy-in-this.html). The photographer was Gitting's white partner, Kay Tobin.

			 <p>I had fun watching the pre-Code &ldquo;This is the Night,&rdquo; dir. Frank Tuttle (Paramount, 1932). Its primary purpose was to be a bit racy and full of laughs. (Thelma Todd&rsquo;s character loses her dress more than once, catching it in a car door, in a cabinet drawer, and on a fence…) The story begins in Paris, before moving to Venice. It is free of fascism, despite the Italian setting, but the incorruptible protagonist played by Lili Damita is clearly hungry in an early scene, a Depression-related circumstance to which the wealthy men appear oblivious. The comedy takes enough twists and turns that it&rsquo;s not clear who will end up with who for much of the time.</p>

			 <img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/166262/2025/img-0686.jpeg" width="90%" alt="Poster. The women described in the detailed caption below are separated into different quadrants with the help of a big 'V', which itself is underlined by the text 'for victory'.">
<p><strong>The American Front for Victory</strong> &ndash; This poster from World War Two operates on two levels. First, it emphasizes the contribution of &ldquo;The American Front&rdquo; to the victory for which the nation was fighting. American front because this was about the home front, the people, many of them women, contributing to victory in industry, in agriculture, through service, and with their savings. Second, the name makes an important statement about the women it pictures working. They are Black. In large parts of the country, racist Americans cast the fitness of Black people as American citizens in doubt, to say nothing of questioning their very humanity.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Here, by contrast, four Black women are depicted doing dignified work for the national cause.</p>
<p>Moving clockwise from the top, one woman, wearing some kind of civilian uniform, is holding a bucket marked &ldquo;save&rdquo; and is participating in either the sale or purchase of &ldquo;Defense Bonds&rdquo;; another is working a potato field with the words &ldquo;strong bodies&rdquo; underneath; there is a woman in a nurse&rsquo;s uniform above the label &ldquo;volunteer service&rdquo;; and a woman can be seen working on an airplane, perhaps installing its propeller. This is a poster proclaiming the importance of the home front and the dignity and honor of the Black women fighting on it.</p>

			 <p>I wrote these to steady myself, but maybe they will be of interest and possible use to others.</p>
<ol>
<li>More people have lived under despots of some kind than have not. Life still finds a way. So do freedom and justice.</li>
<li>Despotism has played a large role in this country&rsquo;s history, too, and the oppressed didn&rsquo;t quit, even sharing their light. Recall the histories of Black Americans and of other othered groups.</li>
<li>Hate the hubristic orange oaf and rocket oligarch for their abuses, if you want, but look for ways to leverage your emotions. Don&rsquo;t let an understandable sense of powerlessness control you. Don&rsquo;t allow the president and his helpmates to continue their assault unopposed.</li>
<li>Start with the basics: Stay informed, but use your attention mindfully; protect your loved ones; rediscover the power of community.</li>
<li>Remind yourself that this administration is no monolith. Neither are the Republican caucuses in the House and Senate, never mind the states.</li>
<li>Every action the administration undertakes will challenge the unity that the GOP enjoys among its own. Overreach will make the coalition that is intent on destroying our government more vulnerable to fracture.</li>
<li>Bide your time, if need be, but look for opportunities to raise awareness of specific problems. Look for ways to push back. Trust that your representatives are doing the same, but also verify.</li>
<li>Get over your disgust at all people who elected this president. Most of these people share many of your values. Some are potential allies. Saying, &ldquo;Told you so!&rdquo; might feel good, but there&rsquo;s no more time for that.</li>
<li>Even the president&rsquo;s supporters can be persuaded to protest against specific policies, including by calling their representatives. Look for the issues that people care about. With time, you might help them to see connections to other issues, but take baby steps, show humility.</li>
<li>The corruptibility of people will favor the current presidency in parts of the government and in civil society, but the presidency&rsquo;s actions in this regard will make it vulnerable to infighting.</li>
<li>Find strength in how weak the administration&rsquo;s actions reveal it to be. It does not trust normal legislative processes, not even when its party controls both houses of Congress.</li>
<li>These people do not trust the FBI, the military, the government they head, or the people who elected them, but they trust in their own ability to purge and to lead the first three against as many of the people as they think necessary. They are wrong. Reliance on force without justice and public support on their side makes them weak.</li>
<li>They think inciting the mob through social media posts is an effective mode of governance. While dangerous, this behavior is another sign of their weakness.</li>
<li>They think threats of primaries are a viable long-term alternative to cooperation with members of their own party in Congress. The rich doners who make these threats viable strengthen neither their party nor the administration over the long term. Skilled cabals might exact high prices, but they do not last.</li>
<li>They know that their rhetoric about trans and other queer people is favored by only a minority, and then largely in the abstract. The same goes for the racist, anti-DEIA cover they employ to discriminate while pretending that they are all about merit.</li>
<li>Having only terrible arguments in their quiver, they rely on epistemic violence and memory erasure&mdash;lies, disinformation, public attacks on those who call them out, bullying teachers, strong-arming universities and schools, crying &ldquo;censorship&rdquo; in spaces they haven&rsquo;t managed to dominate, deleting vital data from government websites, and more.</li>
<li>Their attack against us and our government has been expanded to include our allies, too. Don&rsquo;t get indignant when people in theses countries call all of us out on our tariffs and worse. Look for ways to show solidarity instead.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re feeling exhausted by the assault on all fronts, but this assault takes people, and they are consuming their own at an alarming rate.</li>

The second also underlines the destabilizing effect this power can have on the international system. Americans need to increase their awareness of what tariffs do.

<p>The problem of unchecked presidential power is particularly accute at this moment, as the president attacks critical government institutions and capabilities while flouting Congressional oversight and its power of the purse. Given <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2025/01/31/shit-is-getting-conspiratorially-dark.html">moves against the treasury</a> last week, the president&rsquo;s latest tariff announcements require strong pushback. The president loves tariffs. We need to make the <em>topic</em> of tariffs sexy <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=puck+tariff+cartoons&amp;st=gallery" title="Puck cartoons about tariffs at the Library of Congress">again</a> in order to fight back.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Typically only a small number of career officials control Treasury’s payment systems. Run by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the sensitive systems control the flow of more than $6 trillion annually to households, businesses and more nationwide.… The clash reflects an intensifying battle between Musk and the federal bureaucracy as the Trump administration nears the conclusion of its second week. Musk has sought to exert sweeping control over the inner workings of the U.S. government, installing longtime surrogates at several agencies…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Musk business is getting increasingly dark. Democrats and Republicans should fight this, except there aren&rsquo;t any Republicans in government anymore.</p>

			 <p>If Merz thinks he can control the AfD, he should remember that parliamentary elections have consequences, and political predictions are worth as much as Orange Oaf&rsquo;s word, diddly-squat. Merz should also consider the American grifter-in-chief&rsquo;s takeover of the Republican party, which is no longer recognizable. This path was made easier by the Tea Party nuts of the mid-1990s and early aughts (think debt ceiling and endless obstructionism), but Orange Oaf, who believes nothing, co-opted the party completely. If Merz has learned from Trump that norms need not constrain him, what does he think the AfD has learned?</p>

			 <p>One of the pieces I linked to in my previous post is a &ldquo;must read&rdquo; about scientific speculation and its selective dissemination in the media. Sam Kean, &ldquo;The Comet Panic of 1910, Revisited,&rdquo; <em>Distillations Magazine</em>, January 16, 2025, <a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/stories/magazine/the-comet-panic-of-1910-revisited/">www.sciencehistory.org…</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Colón-Vásquez’s drawing remains a prime example of how interactions between scientists and the public can go wrong: the prestige and imprimatur of science is such that people take even wild speculation at face value sometimes. It’s easy to chuckle over the sillier manifestations of the 1910 panic—comet pills, insurance scams, and the like. But the record left by a frightened teenager also helps Méndez and Acosta-Colón appreciate the &ldquo;blend of fear, fascination, and artistic expression that such events can provoke.&rdquo;</p>

The sky and outer space are one, that is, black and filled with stars."></a></p>
<p>This funny old German postcard about &ldquo;the end of the world&rdquo; caught my attention because of tomorrow&rsquo;s big event in Washington, DC, Orange Oaf&rsquo;s return to the White House. The card feels somewhat prophetic, but the earlier threat it references was celestial, not human. Many people were <a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/stories/magazine/the-comet-panic-of-1910-revisited/">panicking</a> because Earth was expected to pass through the tail of Halley&rsquo;s Comet on May 19, 1910.</p>
<p>One of the signs to the right in the postcard advertises &ldquo;Airplanes for rent | Deliverance from the apocalypse!&rdquo; The other offers big jugs of gasoline, each containing enough to reach (<em>reichend</em> ) the moon, or pungent enough for the odor to carry (<em>riechend</em> ) that far. The airplanes, dirigibles, and hot air balloons for escaping to the moon look as fanciful as their purported purpose.</p>

			 <p>The new version of MacPaw&rsquo;s <a href="https://cleanmymac.com/">CleanMyMac</a> (the successor to CleanMyMac X) is unusable for me. The features sound good, but the animations are so busy, so intrusive, as to make it impossible to look at the app without feeling disoriented. Where is the option to turn all that nonsense off? I need a utility, not entertainment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve cancelled my subscription. When I offered the requested feedback about why, all I got was an automated follow-up request for more details so they can help me make the app work. This is the problem with automated systems that don&rsquo;t allow for a &ldquo;none of the above&rdquo; and &ldquo;human&rdquo; option. My problem is accessibility, but whether that message ever gets through is doubtful.</p>
<p>For now, the old version still works, so I went back to it. But this preview of an entshittified future with MacPaw has made me lose faith. To be fair, though, I&rsquo;ve been losing faith in a lot of products that have unnecessary stuff crammed into them, including MacOS. When my Mac ceases to be supported by Apple security updates, I might just switch over to a basic Linux install.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1921, white Tulsans murdered hundreds of residents of Greenwood, burned their homes and churches, looted their belongings, and locked the survivors in internment camps. Until this day, the Justice Department has not spoken publicly about this race massacre or officially accounted for the horrific events that transpired in Tulsa. This report breaks that silence by rigorous examination and a full accounting of one of the darkest episodes of our nation’s past. This report lays bare new information and shows that the massacre was the result not of uncontrolled mob violence, but of a coordinated, military-style attack on Greenwood.</p>

			 <p>I watched the Ukrainian movie &ldquo;Sniper: The White Raven,&rdquo; dir. Maryan Bushan (Ukraine, 2022), which was filmed before Russia&rsquo;s full-scale invasion. The protagonist comes to this work after Putin&rsquo;s little green men invade his country and murder his family. The film offers a moving counterpoint to the dark comedy, &ldquo;Donbass,&rdquo; dir. Sergei Loznitsa (Ukraine, 2018). The latter presents glimpses of life in territory controlled by Russia, mixing local politics, disinformation, and violence in ways that blur the boundary between reality and alternative factuality. 🇺🇦</p>

			 <p>A book that manages to historicize a century of strongman regimes in an accessible and readable way while maintaining intellectual and scholarly rigor is a helluva thing. If you haven&rsquo;t yet read Ruth Ben-Ghiat, <em>Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present</em> (Norton, 2020), I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>Strongman regimes … turn the economy into an instrument of leader wealth creation, but also encourage changes in ethical and behavioral norms to make things that were illegal or immoral appear acceptable, whether election fraud, torture, or sexual assault.…</p>
<p>Rulers who come into office with a criminal record … have a head start. They know that making the government a refuge for criminals who don’t have to learn to be lawless hastens the &lsquo;contagion effect.&rsquo; So does granting amnesties and pardons, which indebt individuals to the leader and make blackmailers, war criminals, and murderers available for service.</p>

<p>I enjoyed rewatching &ldquo;Saboteur,&rdquo; dir. Alfred Hitchcock (Universal Pictures, 1942). It offers plenty of action and suspense from Los Angeles to New York City, inside and outside, with positive patriotic messaging that could put twenty-first-century billionaires and MAGAheads to shame.</p>

This was her second U.S. film, coming on the heels of Starnberg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Morocco&rdquo; (1930). She doesn&rsquo;t sing this time, but her piano playing is striking. As with <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/12/14/this-evening-i.html">&ldquo;Blonde Venus,&quot;</a> her sense of duty and love put her in the crosshairs of men and their law.</p>

			 <p>Just watched &ldquo;The Roaring Twenties,&rdquo; dir. Raoul Walsh (Warner Bros., 1939). It starts in World War I and moves into prohibition and a spell of joblessness, followed by bootlegging, prosperity, and a rollicking good time, except for the unrequited love. Then things fall apart for the film&rsquo;s main protagonist, played by James Cagney.</p>

			 <p>Since &ldquo;influence&rdquo; is <em>Time</em>&rsquo;s  criterion for selecting a person of the year, its 2024 choice makes sense. Nonetheless, it is hard not to see that metric as a symptom of mainstream journalism&rsquo;s would-be objectivity &ndash; the very attitude behind its destructive bothsidesism.</p>

			 <p>I watched &ldquo;Passage to Marseille,&rdquo; dir. Michael Curtiz (Warner Bros., 1944), this evening.</p>
<p>I forgot about the shocking scene in which Humphrey Bogart&rsquo;s character machine-guns the surviving crew of the German plane he&rsquo;d just downed at sea. The audience in 1944 was meant to sympathize with this act. After all, that crew had just tried to bomb the small civilian freighter. I don&rsquo;t know if such a scene would have worked in a Hollywood film much earlier, but it did in 1944. Was this fictional atrocity an indication of American popular culture&rsquo;s brutalization in World War II?</p>

The huge map on the floor of the Post Office Department here is all out of kilter these days due to the aggression in Europe. Many are the embarrassing questions being asked officials about when Mr. Farley is going to do something about Ethiopia, Austria and Czechoslovakia. The answer so far has been - nothing. Probably the Post Office is waiting to see what will happen next on the continent. Miss Edna Strain is inspecting the damage done by the ambitious dictators. 4-12-39</p>

			 <p>Last week I watched &ldquo;Citizen Kane&rdquo; (dir. Orson Wells, 1941) for the first time in more decades than I can remember. I didn&rsquo;t really enjoy the experience, maybe because the initial premise (tearing a boy away from his home for a huge inheritance) is as misshapen as the psychological development of the lead role, Charles Foster Kane. There is also the crass materialism, the emptiness of Kane&rsquo;s soul, and his insatiable appetite for the adoration of others. His unhappy loneliness in the end as the only occupant (not including servants) of a giant castle filled with statues and other valuable artifacts from Europe was presumably the point of this bleak story, one that might be construed as a moral tale.</p>
<p>I should have liked the references to newspaper moguls and opinion making to be less oblique, though that might have pushed one of them too far in real life. (Apparently William Randolph Hearst did what he could to suppress the film because it hit too close to home.) Or maybe this context was secondary to Kane&rsquo;s personal development anyway. After all, this was an era when foreign correspondents <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/11/30/reading-notes-last.html">reported</a> on populists and dictators, and psychoanalysis was in vogue. Sure, it was an era of mass politics, but these masses had their great men, for better or worse.</p>
<p>None of this is a criticism of the film. I just didn&rsquo;t enjoy it. Perhaps the biggest problem is how readily Kane can stand in for certain men in our own time. The film&rsquo;s dark, fatalistic overtones reinforced this effect in my mind. Still, there is one external factor that helped me to contextualize &ldquo;Citizen Kane&rdquo; better this time around: I actually saw the <a href="https://hearstcastle.org">Hearst Castle</a> in 2018, a truly extraordinary monument, fascinating and unsettling at the same time.</p>

		<a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/11/30/reading-notes-last-call-at.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-11-30 22:51:00 -0400">Nov 30, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I finished reading <em>Last Call at the Hotel Imperial: The Reporters Who Took On a World at War</em> (Random House 2022) by Deborah Cohen. At times I got impatient because it was as much about the journalists' private and inner lives as their reporting, but I realized that this was the point and decided not to skip over those sections. Cohen&rsquo;s protagonists were people with experiences and viewpoints relevant to their work and our understanding of it. As journalists, they had been taught &ldquo;impartiality&rdquo; (resembling bothsidism today) but the dictatorships, wars, and atrocities they witnessed demanded a viewpoint, even if their editors disagreed. It was for these viewpoints that I had <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/10/24/am-thinking-deborah.html">begun reading</a> the book in the first place.</p>
<p>Cohen focuses on the four biggest star journalists of the era, John Gunther, H. R. Knickbocker, James Vincent Sheean, and Dorothy Thompson, whose lives became closely entwined, and who left behind a prodigious written record for Cohen to mine. Thus, we learn about their upbringings, educations, and early career experiences; their love, sex, and reproductive lives; their sexuality and mental health; their exposure to psychoanalysis, and more. This period of changing cultural mores adds an important backdrop to the events and people they wrote about, and it helps us understand the reporters themselves.</p>
<p>Cohen&rsquo;s focus on these individuals and their significant others, especially Frances Fineman Gunther, hints at the relevance of the individual in a few other ways besides context and viewpoint. First, there is the question of private lives in situations where public affairs tend to crowd everything private out. Next, there is the question of the role of individual agency in history. This issue concerned Cohen&rsquo;s protagonists, who met many of the leading political figures of the day. It was also relevant to the issue of the masses and the extent to which circumstances or individual characteristics <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/11/22/who-goes-nazi.html">made them into Nazis</a>, for example. Finally, there is the question of the reporters' own impacts.</p>
<p>Cohen notes in the prologue that the image of the United States embodied by the large number of American journalists overseas was at odds with the old isolationist stereotype. Clearly there was an appetite for information about the world. Moreover, the travels by ship and plane of her protagonists points to the many economic, professional, and personal entanglements of the United States with the rest of the world despite the strength of nationalisms and protectionist tariff regimes. Cohen&rsquo;s book takes us across Europe, including to fascist Italy, the Spanish Civil War, as well as Weimar and Nazi Germany, to whose murderous intentions they were by no means blind. We also see Ethiopia at the moment of Mussolini&rsquo;s invasion, Palestine, Egypt, the USSR, pre- and postcolonial India, and civil-war China, not to mention the U.S. Jim Crow South.</p>
<p>The book is long, probably too long to teach undergraduates, unless one assigned specific sections, but it is accessibly written, affordably priced, and has received favorable reviews outside the academy, including in <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, and the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>. Readers should be prepared to look up names and descriptive vocabulary they might not know, which is easy enough with today&rsquo;s mobile phones.</p>

			 <p>In 1936, Dorothy Thompson observed in her newspaper column that &ldquo;dictatorships often have quite different interpretations of words from liberal democracies. . . . In the dictionary of democracies,&rdquo; for example, &ldquo;<em>peace</em> is a desirably permanent condition of amicable relations with other nations. In the dictionary of dictatorships peace means: a quiet undisturbed period in which to prepare for war . . .&quot;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;between nations&rdquo; excluded asymmetric colonial conflicts, so the difference Thompson painted was quite real. In fact, it was the entire argument of Erich Ludendorff&rsquo;s 1935 screed <em>Der totale Krieg</em> (Total War). In that book, Ludendorff flipped Carl von Clausewitz&rsquo;s famous dictum on its head. Instead of understanding war as the pursuit of political aims by other means, states had to understand war as the driving force behind all politics.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Regarding &ldquo;nonaggression&rdquo; in international relations, Thompson wrote,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>liberal democracies mean . . . simply the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy. Both Russian and German dictatorships mean by it the substitution of revolution for other weapons. Neither Russia nor Germany considers the fomenting of internal strife in countries which they want to bring under their influence to be aggression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our own time, Russia, now a different creature, is playing a similar game inside NATO countries. Observers in these democracies refer to Russia&rsquo;s current suite of activities as &ldquo;hybrid warfare,&rdquo; although their governments often play down these activities. Thompson&rsquo;s discussion of &ldquo;war&rdquo; itself can help to explain why, provided we keep the &ldquo;between nations&rdquo; qualification in mind. &ldquo;For the democracies war is armed conflict between nations, to be avoided as an unmitigated catastrophe. Above all, war is regarded as an <em>abnormal</em> condition. In the Russian dictionary,&rdquo; on the other hand, &ldquo;war is either an inevitable byproduct of the struggle of capitalist countries for markets, or the permanent, unremitting and inevitable struggle between classes for power.&rdquo; The first theory of war came from <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/index.htm" title="Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (Marxists.org)">Lenin&rsquo;s interpretation</a> of imperialism and the World War (1914&ndash;18). The second was the basic dialectical understanding of history as class conflict posited by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/index.htm" title="Marx Engels Archive (Marxists.org)">Marx and Engels</a> in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>In contrast to the USSR&rsquo;s take on war, &ldquo;in the Fascist dictionary it is the necessary and normal condition in which heroic nations and personalities reach their highest potential. . . .&rdquo; Such thinking could be found in the democracies, too, especially in the two decades or so before the First World War. After all, the educated learned Latin everywhere in the west, including the Roman poet Horace&rsquo;s phrase, <em>&ldquo;dulce et decorum est pro patria mori&rdquo;</em> (It is sweet and fitting to die for one’s country.) During that war, Winfred Own referred to that sentiment as <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46560/dulce-et-decorum-est" title="Dulce et Decorum Est by Winfred Owen (Poetry Foundation)">&ldquo;the old Lie.&quot;</a> And many politicians did everything they could to avoid the next war, leading to the catastrophic extreme of Neville Chamberlain <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/neville-chamberlain" title="The British Policy of Appeasement Toward Hitler and Nazi Germany (Holocaust Encyclopedia)">appeasing</a> Hitler, while the United States pursued an <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-united-states-isolation-intervention" title="The United States: Isolation-Intervention (Holocaust Encyclopedia)">isolationist</a> foreign policy.</p>
<p>Two related terms for Thompson were &ldquo;honor&rdquo; and &ldquo;dishonor.&rdquo; We do not consciously use them much in twenty-first-century international relations, but Thompson&rsquo;s explanation is not hard to understand.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Honor in England means allegiance to accepted standards of conduct. Honor in Germany and Italy means prestige. Dishonor in the Anglo-Saxon dictionary is a crime which one commits against oneself; in the Fascist dictionary it means a crime which is committed against one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following this logic, the U.S. dishonored itself when it turned to torture in Iraq. Similarly, our former and next president dishonored our country, our military, and his office by pardoning American war criminals. In the process, he didn&rsquo;t honor international treaty obligations either. That is because his understanding of honor is more like that of the fascists of the 1930s. Anyone who takes him down a peg has injured him and faces retribution, much like a gang member who can&rsquo;t afford to lose face. Looking weak is unbearable to this man, whereas conventional rules and fair play are for suckers. The current Russian president follows a similar gangland code, restoring his injured honor by having opponents poisoned or fall out of windows. There might well be a sense of injured honor involved in his attempt to destroy Ukraine.</p>
<p>Thompson&rsquo;s column underlined something with which we are all too familiar these days. We speak the same language as our enemies. We use the same words. But our common language both obscures and fosters different perceptions of reality that leave us at cross purposes. The Russians talk about &ldquo;information war.&quot;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> And Alex Jones spread disinformation in the United States with a profitable website called InfoWars. Perhaps the problem goes even deeper, and individual words themselves have become players in our fight for the soul and honor of this nation. Maybe we need a comparative political dictionary to bridge the gap or at least bring the conflict into sharper focus.</p>

			 <p>These photos of Japanese-Americans and a few resident aliens on their way to internment for the duration of World War II are accompanied by captions that avoid the language of imprisonment or confinement. Instead of internment, there is talk of &ldquo;evacuation&rdquo; and the War Relocation Authority.</p>
<p>These pictures also suggest what a rupture the location of their internment would represent. It is hard to imagine these urbanites stepping out into the barely settled terrain they were headed to, even if an advanced party of men without dependents was sent out a few weeks in advance to prepare for the others' arrival.</p>

			 <p>I sometimes read on social media about the apparent contradiction between right-wingers' positive attitudes toward tech and their negative attitudes toward a lot of medicine. After all, both are rooted in science. That said, there is a commonality between these two sets of attitudes: the role of regulation. A lot of tech is under- or unregulated, and the supplements that Trump&rsquo;s favored quacks and talking heads peddle are not regulated either. Medicine and medications, on the other hand, <em>are</em> regulated. And we have mandatory public health measures.</p>
<p>This is not to say that there is anything principled about their dislike of regulation. If the FDA was founded in 1906 with the support of business because expert-based standards and trust would benefit business, that insight seems to be absent from the current discourse. Instead, the quacks, grifters, and monopoly capitalists value their freedom to muck about with society and the environment as they please, secure in the knowledge that they&rsquo;ll have the might to be right on the so-called open market of goods and ideas, especially after capturing the federal government.</p>

<p>Good and healthy societies do not require to be ruled by terror. This is not to deny that terror is an enormously effective means of creating a menacing machine. The shrewd exploitations of fear is an ancient means of ruling. But it is also a dangerous way of ruling. For one thing, it cuts the rulers themselves off from reality. In a society where no one can complain, no one knows the depths of resentment ready to flare up once the opportunity comes.</p>

<p>Here is a once popular meme in Russia that the thin-skinned Putin banned, thereby making it more popular (artist unknown). This is one of the examples that J.

			 <p>Local and regional newspapers have been dying at an alarming rate. At the same time, the 2024 election has underscored significant failings in the best of our big newspapers: bothsidesism, clickbait headlines, groupthink and superficial analysis, sexism, casual racism, transphobia, pedantic fact-checking that doesn&rsquo;t consider substance, uncritical repetition of lies from the temperamental orange guy and those who have sworn fealty to him, sanewashing, interference with editorial decisions by billionaire owners, and so on. While there&rsquo;s currently no living entirely without such outlets, relying on them exclusively isn&rsquo;t an option.

			 <p>The GOP will have the House too?! If so, the question becomes, does the GOP party leader, the orange dementor, control both chambers of Congress? Or will some of these folks remember that they control a separate branch of government? In the Soviet Union, the General Secretary of the Communist Party ran the show. Is that what the GOP wants? Or are they just enjoying a ride on the winning candidate&rsquo;s coattails? I&rsquo;m sure lots of them can be kept in line with threats of physical harm or the release of komprimat, and others could be bought off with spending largesse (read: corruption) by the government and by would-be beneficiaries of government contracts.</p>
<p>Wild cards: How narrow is the GOP majority in the House? Will GOP replacements for the big rotten cheese&rsquo;s cabinet picks be able to beat Democrats in those districts?</p>

			 <p>I was quite startled by these and related images from 1917 because they show a lot of men being rounded up for removal in box cars in the hot dessert sun. It turns out that this was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisbee_Deportation">Bisbee Deportation</a> of IWW strikers in 1917. Some 1,300 people were kidnapped and put on a train in the summer heat by a 2,200-man posse. The action, ordered by Phelps Dodge, was illegal but supposedly not covered by federal law, only state law, and the state never prosecuted. In fact, one photographer, Dix, saw a money-making opportunity in the forcible removal of workers from Arizona to New Mexico. The Library of Congress holds the first, darker image below as a photo print, whereas it has the other three lighter images by the same photographer as postcards, suggesting the existence of at least a local market for souvenirs.</p>

			 <p>My mother has been watching her church service online so she can hear it. That means I hear parts too. And I can see what&rsquo;s happening on the desktop I&rsquo;m streaming to the TV with. Different vibe today. Pastor began by inviting people to settle, to be present, to allow themselves to have their feelings. I also saw more people in attendance than is often the case. The service emphasized themes such as inclusion, compassion, and justice, the last term describing something very different from the hypocritical, moralizing, vengeful God that I despised and rejected in my youth. If I had a religious bone left in my body, this place could be one point of connection with the local community.</p>

			 <p>I can&rsquo;t help but think that the Kremlin once again misunderstands the situation, as they did in February 2022. Sure, the next U.S. president likes rubbing elbows with &ldquo;tough guy&rdquo; dictators, and the guardrails of expertise and institutions mean nothing to him; nevertheless, he won&rsquo;t be completely free to do as he pleases. Think of the old guard Republicans who know what&rsquo;s at stake in Europe. Enough of them were able to convince the guy in Mar-a-Lago to tell Mike Johnson to finally approve funds for Ukraine earlier this year. More importantly, even if his supporters are gung-ho America Firsters, they feel threatened by China, Putin&rsquo;s close ally. If they haven&rsquo;t put two and two together about the global ramifications of Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, their obsession with tariffs has everything to do with China, Russia&rsquo;s closest supporter.</p>
<p>In fact, will the jumping, hooting, squealing Mr. Cybertruck&rsquo;s interests in China throw a spanner in his current machinations to treat our government like an extension of his personal business interests? Mr. Orange-in-a-Suit&rsquo;s supporters are expecting action on China, and their guy with the tie needs their adulation&mdash;not to mention their votes in the 2026 midterms. Besides, how open will his oil guys be to welcoming Russia back to legitimate global oil and natural gas markets while prices are low? I can&rsquo;t claim to know all the variables, and I know the occupant of the White House matters a great deal. Still, as unpredictable, unscrupulous, inhumane, and disloyal as Mr. Bad Hairpiece is, he will not be operating in a vacuum free from the influence of powerful players calling in their chits.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, there can be no doubt that the Russian terrorist-in-chief and his security apparatus have already proven how blinkered they were about Ukraine, not to mention the unity NATO has projected. It is equally nonsensical for the Kremlin to think of NATO as a collection of American-led satellite states, pace Russia&rsquo;s rabid propagandists Margarita Simonyan and Vladimir Soloviev. Why should the Kremlin understand the United States any better, if it can&rsquo;t even acknowledge Ukrainian agency? And just how well would the next U.S. president respond to threats, when Putin realizes that flattery won&rsquo;t get him what he wants in Ukraine.</p>

			 <p>How effective will the American military be after the next administration wreaks havoc on the Pentagon so that the president might have the loyalists he needs in order to command them as he sees fit, including even direct them against the American people? How much material and moral corruption will these measures lead to? May the military&rsquo;s talent pool be deep and ethical enough to survive the corrupting onslaught of what&rsquo;s coming. Mr. Huge Crowd&rsquo;s pardoning of war criminals last time round suggests how little he understands military morale and discipline. We know what he thinks of expertise, and he paid no price for disrespecting our fallen.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I doubt I&rsquo;ll have the bandwidth to follow the machinations in Washington&rsquo;s halls of power, as I did during the previous administration. I got out of the habit under the current one because I was exhausted, didn&rsquo;t feel threatened, and ended up living a twelve-hour drive away. And now I want to focus on the parts of my life and world where my individual agency, talents, and interests might be leveraged for things more constructive, more life-affirming.</p>
<p>First, though, I&rsquo;ll allow myself to imagine some of the worst coming our way, just to get the darkness out of my mind and into words: the destruction of the regulatory state and of our public medical, environmental, climate, and weather research infrastructure; the violent and cruel erasure of entire communities; the enslavement, indentured servitude, or other forms of abusive exploitation of people without papers under the &ldquo;protection&rdquo; of unscrupulous employers, landlords, neighbors, and government agents; the creation of a new generation of Hoovervilles inhabited by people with no health insurance, no immunizations, and pensioners whose Social Security checks and Medicare benefits no longer keep them housed; preventable contagious diseases killing our children; lawfully mandated medical malpractice killing girls, women, and trans men with the bad luck to become pregnant; the loss of LGBTQ+ family, friends, and community members to exile, to self-harm, and to the violence of bullies given license by their chosen leader; the possibility that insulin might grow out of my reach; the knowledge that Medicare will never cover the costs of help with elder care while I still need such help, and while private equity funds squeeze what they can out of old folks homes, leaving them woefully understaffed, their populations vulnerable to contagious disease, inattention, and abuse.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to go this way, not even under the next president. But do we think a GOP-controlled Senate will respect the filibuster the next time around, if they manage to get the House too? Isn&rsquo;t that just one more convention that the next president can demand they drop? And have any of them demonstrated even the slightest willingness to defend their institution, sure in the knowledge that they are part of a separate branch of government? GOP representatives in the House are no better, as they demonstrated during the previous president&rsquo;s two impeachments.</p>
<p>American presidents have enormous amounts of power, and now, it seems, controlling the party and the mob will give the next president even more. Or will some Republican legislators put their constituents ahead of the slash-and-burn ideologues? What groups will they decide government might have a role in protecting? Of course, the House could still flip Democratic. Some Republicans could develop a conscience. Or the ambitions, incompetence, and contradictory aims, values, and beliefs of Orange Face&rsquo;s supporters could lead to lots of friendly fire and delays.</p>
<p>Caveat: the GOP marched in lockstep to regain the presidency, but we have no idea what goes on behind the scenes. It&rsquo;s possible they prefer to carry out dissent internally. It&rsquo;s also a sure thing that Mr. Red Tie will keep all eyes on himself, with lots of help from the media, while the poisons are concocted in Congress and in other parts of the executive branch.</p>

			 <p>Seth Meyers was unwatchable last night because he devoted time to the geriatric baby&rsquo;s public utterances. Stephen Colbert was kinder. Every time he said, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a clip,&rdquo; it turned out to be something cute or amusing. Jimmy Kimmel spoke from the heart without giving dry-rot makeup man quotes or clips. I turned off Desi Lydic pretty quickly because the clips of journalists and pundits annoyed me, but I tried again today by the light of day.

			 <p>For more than 25 years, I had no representation in Congress because I lived in DC. That&rsquo;s changed because of my caregiving responsibilities, so it will be bittersweet on Tuesday when I cast a straight Democratic ballot in Conway, NH.

			 <p>American billionaires who intervened in their newspapers' endorsements know that the orange guy is a vindictive prat, unlike Harris. Nonetheless, their actions and Musk&rsquo;s murder of Twitter ought to lead to legislation that limits or undercuts the concentration of media ownership, regardless of who the owners support. We cannot become another oligarchy à la Autocracy, Inc.</p>
<p>I suspect, though, that this is a fight for another day, if ever. The electorate needs Harris to come through on important bread-and-butter issues first; Harris will need to work coalitions in Congress to increase pressure on Russia&rsquo;s terrorist regime; and on and on.</p>
<p>It seems as if there is always a big and urgent need. So how do we address the fundamentals, including not only media concentration but also campaign finance, gerrymandering, Supreme Court oversight, the Electoral College, a primary system that favors ideological purity over substance, minority rule by those who win only a plurality of votes, and statehood for DC and for any other territories who desire it? Where do we start?</p>
<p>If Republicans were really concerned about media bias, that could form a basis for bipartisan work on media concentration. The past decade or so has shown, however, that they do not want free and fair discussions. Recently, &ldquo;free speech&rdquo; absolutists have given the lie to that notion with Twitter&rsquo;s metamorphosis into X(itter), which followed on the heels of &ldquo;alternative facts&rdquo; and a cultural shift that privileges personal belief over all forms of evidence. Consider, too, the pressure to ban books and not teach darker chapters of our history.</p>
<p>So where or how do we start? Republicans' singular focus on attaining power in the states, in the judiciary, and in the federal government paid off, at least in the short term. They ended Roe; they&rsquo;ve come close to establishing presidential immunity; and they have big plans to blow up most of our remaining institutions. They&rsquo;ve also enabled the blossoming of unregulated militias with freely available assault rifles.</p>
<p>My hope is that enough Americans see through the orange one&rsquo;s grift to put an end to his ambitions for a second term once and for all. I would then like to see Harris appointees hold the worst of the conspiring putschists and domestic terrorists to account in timely fashion so as to delegitimize that kind of opposition. But how do we get from there to a culture that rewards candidates who respect the Constitution and their fellow human beings enough to get the people&rsquo;s work done?</p>

<p>This <em>Puck</em> cartoon from 1880 portrayed immigration in positive terms.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Uncle Sam stands at the entrance to a wooden &ldquo;U.S. Ark of Refuge,&rdquo; a U.S. flag to the side. The image offers a strong contrast to the ramparts Uncle Sam stands at in <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/10/29/the-unrestricted-dumping.html">1903</a> and  behind in <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2019/02/08/walls.html">1916</a>. Beside him is a list of &ldquo;free&rdquo; things offered by &ldquo;U.S.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FREE EDUCATION<br>
FREE LAND<br>
FREE SPEECH<br>
FREE BALLOT<br>
FREE LUNCH.<br>
     U.S.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The meaning of &ldquo;free&rdquo; varies here. Sometimes it has to do with &ldquo;liberty&rdquo; (free speech and the secret ballot), and other times &ldquo;no cost.&rdquo; If public (&ldquo;free&rdquo;) education is an achievement some in our own time wish to destroy, its existence was bound up with both senses of &ldquo;free.&rdquo; No tuition was required, sure, but it was also a precondition for a free people and for making Americans. &ldquo;Free land&rdquo; in this list would have meant federal lands according to the terms of the various Homestead Acts. But &ldquo;free lunch&rdquo;? What was that about?</p>
<p>This last item was initially a head scratcher for me. I thought it might be a comment or joke about immigrant expectations, but it seems the saying &ldquo;no such thing as a free lunch&rdquo; only gained currency during the middle decades of the twentieth-century. In fact, American saloons were offering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_lunch">free lunches</a> at the time of this cartoon, so there really was such a thing for those who liked their beer and whiskey. Given the loads of correspondence and rumors between Europe and the United States, this kind of knowledge would have filtered through, too.</p>
<p>Because saloons are the context of these lunches, it is tempting to gender these free lunches &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; and assume the existence of a social critique of intemperate immigrant men. The image, however, shows heterosexual couples in the prime of life, suggesting that such gendered moralizing was not part of the artist&rsquo;s intention. Moreover, <em>Puck</em> had begun its life as a German-language publication in the previous decade, and the artist-publisher Joseph-Keppler had immigrated from Austria.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Highlighting the list of attractions on the door is the metaphorically clear sky over the &ldquo;ark.&rdquo; Behind the migrants, to the east, are dark storm clouds with black carrion-seeking scavengers in them. The clouds themselves are monsters labeled &ldquo;WAR&rdquo; and &ldquo;DISTRESS.&rdquo; War entailed not only destruction but also <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2017/06/23/war-gender-and.html">mandatory military service</a> of varying terms. Distress, in this context, probably meant economic distress. Europe was in the middle of a long depression, while it was continuing to experience great socio-economic changes in the course of its ongoing industrialization.</p>
<p>Adding more economic and political arguments to the mix, more liberty, a sign in the middle advertises more benefits to life in the United States:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NO OPPRESSIVE TAXES  <br>
NO EXPENSIVE KINGS  <br>
NO COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE<br>
NO KNOUTS [OR] DUNGEONS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cartoon&rsquo;s pairing of dark and light, of the prospects of distress or prosperity, represented what migration discourse in our own time refers to as push and pull factors. Beneath the cartoon is a quote from the <em>N.Y. Statistical Review</em> that highlights the cartoonist&rsquo;s main interest: &ldquo;We may safely say that the present influx of immigration to the United States is something unprecedented in our generation.&rdquo; The detailed cartoon offered a context for this rise.</p>
<p class="callout">UPDATE: On Bluesky, @resonanteye.bsky.social reminded me of the Page Act of 1875, which excluded Chinese women. That made me think of the two single men at the end of the line in this cartoon because one of them appears to be Chinese. It is likely that this represented an acknowledgement of the Page Act. It also seems possible that the inclusion of this figure amounted to a critique of it.

They should also make clear what organization they&rsquo;re working for, not just what candidate they&rsquo;re supporting.

			 <p>I used to occasionally run across Winslow Homer&rsquo;s wood engravings of the American Civil War, which were widely circulated in <em>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</em>, but this is the first work of his I&rsquo;ve seen that deals with immigrant factory workers in the textile mills of Lawrence, Massachusetts. Note the mix of genders and ages, including the presence of young children. This was not work that could feed a whole family. No matter the difficult pecuniary circumstances of his subjects, however, Homer portrayed them with dignity.</p>

<p>This color cartoon by Louis Dalrymple appeared in <em>Judge</em> magazine in 1903.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It linked immigration to national security by portraying Italian immigrants in ways that prefigured Trump&rsquo;s despicable, racist rhetoric about &ldquo;bad hombres&rdquo; and pet-eaters in the present presidential race. The federal government, personified here as Uncle Sam, comes off as old and ineffectual.</p>
<p>At least, that&rsquo;s what I see. Here: Old Uncle Sam stands at the ramparts of fortress America, bounded by the sea. The smoke from his pipe forms a wreath to his left. In that appears the late President William McKinley, assassinated in 1901 by the Polish-American anarchist Leon Czolgosz. Uncle Sam has an arm and hand around the flagpole and a cane in the other hand. Rats, monkeys, and other immigrating vermin emerge from the water, clamber up the rampart, and scurry away.</p>
<p>Some of the dehumanized immigrants are armed with a knife or pistol, and they wear a floppy, broad-brimmed hat or a bandana in anarchist red or the Italian tricolor. Their weapons and head apparel read &ldquo;Socialist,&rdquo; &ldquo;Anarchist,&rdquo; &ldquo;Murderer,&rdquo; &ldquo;Assassination,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mafia.&rdquo; More inhuman riffraff falls from a garbage chute marked, &ldquo;Direct from the slums of Europe daily.&rdquo; There is also a cluster of regular gray rats in the harbor.</p>
<p>The message is clear. The immigrants, in this case Italians, are criminal, radical, or just socially undesirable. They are other, vermin, and their presence threatens the country.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t think that would-be MAGA putchists should be under any illusions about the Biden administration&rsquo;s willingness and ability to use force to defend the results of the upcoming election, should that become necessary. Public officials acting in bad faith will only be able to go so far without risking prison. Yes, many of us are nervous because of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s interference in 2000, the January 6 debacle, and the work the GOP has been doing to undermine the upcoming election in battleground states. But the bad-faith actors are delusional. They might try some tricks, but most won&rsquo;t stick their necks out. The country will happily embrace a clear result in Harris&rsquo;s favor, as it did for Biden. It will just replace the ageism with sexism and racism.</p>

			 <p>Societies, societal attitudes, and cultural norms change, but people not so much. Positive societal developments reinforce a healthy sense of progress and purpose, but they also trick us into taking too much for granted. Blind to the darkest parts of our own natures, we are caught off guard when the greed, cynicism, hubris, fear, prejudice, and hatred of individuals and mobs assert themselves.</p>
<p>The paradoxical relationship between societal change and human nature can be confounding, but it must not be permitted to immobilize us. There are so many examples of people following their better natures in the final weeks of this electoral fight, so many doing their best to be brave and not despair.</p>

			 <p>I see <em>History of Knowledge</em> has migrated from WordPress.com to Hypotheses.org. Given all the nonsense that Automattic has been putting its clients through, I am glad. It should have a nice long life on that platform. With its new host, it loses some of its functionality, but them&rsquo;s the breaks.</p>
<p>One peculiarity: the Hypotheses portal doesn&rsquo;t accept custom domains. Also, the GHI gave up the historyofknowledge.net domain. Fortunately, the new domain pops right up on a DuckDuckGo search for &ldquo;History of Knowledge blog&rdquo; – <a href="https://historyofknowledge.hypotheses.org">https://historyofknowledge.hypotheses.org</a>.</p>
<p>I see the team has also enabled comments. Given what&rsquo;s happened to Twitter, this makes a lot of sense. Of course, I&rsquo;d love to see them actually leave Xitter for Mastodon, Bluesky, or even Threads.</p>
<p><small>Aug. 14, 2025: I updated some of the information regarding the blog&rsquo;s migration.</small></p>

			 <p>A German hashtag phenomenon I ran across on Mastodon and Bluesky recently is #FotoVorschlag (photo suggestion). The idea is to post one&rsquo;s own photo based on the day&rsquo;s keyword from <a href="https://photog.social/@FotoVorschlag">@FotoVorschlag@photog.social</a> or <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/fotovorschlag.bsky.social">@fotovorschlag.bsky.social</a>. Today&rsquo;s was &ldquo;Bach,&rdquo; which is not only the name of a composer but also German for &ldquo;brook&rdquo; or &ldquo;stream.&rdquo; I took the first photo here near Diana&rsquo;s Baths in North Conway and Bartlett, NH, on May 22, 2023.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On August 27th, I posted a mid-to-late 1940s photo of <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/08/27/two-us-navy.html">two Black sailors browsing books in a library section marked &ldquo;Negro Books.&quot;</a> In response, a couple people on my socials expressed outrage or sadness over the segregation they thought they were seeing. That makes sense if one doesn&rsquo;t consider the book titles I mentioned or the link to a related post here titled <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/19/black-librarians-and.html">Reading about Black Librarians and Knowledge Formation</a>.</p>
<p>Thing is, though, books could be powerful wherever librarians made them available in their collections and discoverable by their readers. That&rsquo;s why I see in the image two sailors browsing books in a thematic library display that highlighted a selection of books of probable interest to Black people. The photo&rsquo;s provenance also suggests as much: the U.S. Navy Department&rsquo;s Office of Public Relations produced it, and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture preserved it. What&rsquo;s more, there is the photo&rsquo;s suggestive chronological proximity to the end of the war and to Harry S. Truman&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_9981">desegregation order</a> for the U.S military in 1948. Yes, the photo was taken in a broader context of prejudice and segregation, even atrocity, but the story does not end there.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t allow our knowledge of historical and present-day racism to blind us to signs in the image of people with agency who worked toward a more just world. Someone in the navy&rsquo;s PR office decided or was ordered to take and distribute such a photo, or have this done. One or more people in a navy library ordered and displayed the books that caught the photographer&rsquo;s eye, perhaps owing to the cataloging innovations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_B._Porter">Dorothy B. Porter</a>. Moreover, someone shaped the command climate in which these things transpired.</p>
<p>Whatever led to these particular sailors posing for this picture, the camera recorded two young black men doing something about their present and future. We see them serving their country. We see them acquiring knowledge about it that had emancipatory potential.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing in this kind of framing can negate the history of racism in this country. What thinking about individual agency can do is open our eyes to the humanity and strength of the people who endured and made lives for themselves despite the oppression. The books on the shelves written by Black authors were also evidence of such spirit. And the unknown characters behind the making of this photograph? It is productive to think of them as individuals who made choices within a specific institutional, social, and cultural matrix. Human agency matters.</p>

			 <p>I really enjoyed Peter Pomerantsev, <em>This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War against Reality</em> (2019). He pursues his subject across much of the globe, seeking out people who have shaped fractured information spaces in pursuit of their activist or political consulting goals. And he historicizes the development of contemporary information wars and ideological confusion by relating these phenomena to developments during and since the late Cold War.</p>
<p>He lends coherence to the sprawling tale by jumping around places and phenomena in an impressionistic style, using his father&rsquo;s literary and radio biography as a reference point. The father was investigated by the KGB, which led to his family&rsquo;s exile from the Soviet Union. The son later worked in Russian television for nearly a decade, gaining an insider&rsquo;s view of Putin&rsquo;s Russia that turned out to be more broadly relevant than he had initially realized (Pomerantsev, <em>Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible</em> [2014]).</p>

			<h1><a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/08/21/workplace-safety-posters.html">Workplace Safety Posters, ca. 1936–40</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/08/21/workplace-safety-posters.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-08-21 22:05:54 -0400">Aug 21, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I am enjoying Depression-era workplace safety posters from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration" title="Detailed Wikipedia entry for the WPA">Works Progress Administration</a> (WPA). They evoke a time when the power of government was effectively leveraged for good. If you live in the United States, there is a good chance you&rsquo;ve encountered WPA building and infrastructure projects. One WPA program was the Federal Arts Project, which put artists to work. To get a feel for the diversity of programs this art supported, see the Library of Congress&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/wpapos/">online collection</a>.</p>
<p class="callout">Unfortunately, the WPA also built and helped staff internment camps for Americans of Japanese descent after the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941. This part of the story underlines the negative potential of government power when racism shapes policy.</p>
<p>Besides the four posters that follow this text, I include a photograph of an alley behind a row of houses with tiny back yards in Baltimore. If you look closely at this image from the Farm Security Administration, you can see a WPA poster attached to an open door in the bottom left-hand corner. It is captioned &ldquo;Stop accidents before they stop you.&rdquo; The building itself appears to be part of a factory of some kind because only a door and a single big wall with windows is visible, visually distinct from the opposite side of the alley, where all the little houses are.</p>
<p>These posters remind me of the ongoing importance of government for writing, publicizing, and enforcing workplace safety regulations. They connect past concerns about workplace conditions to countless reports of workplace injuries and sickness in our own time. They also link to family stories past and present, whether handed down or forgotten, whether taught or ignored in schools, workplaces, and union gatherings.</p>
<p>My grandmother&rsquo;s father was killed in an avoidable industrial accident in 1917 when she was six years old. The lathe he operated in a Cleveland factory had no safety guard, and then his luck ran out. He left behind six children and their mother, the oldest of them able to work. The sudden loss of this man represented a trauma that no one talked about in my childhood, and I only learned the barebones details from my mother this past year.</p>
<p>I often wonder if and how such trauma is passed down in other families, and why its causes are silenced or not. My mind goes there because I imagine that millions of Americans—from across the political spectrum—come from families with such experiences, even if these were not handed down from the past. And I wonder what, if any, knowledge about these many pasts might do to change their attitudes today.</p>
<p>This thought ties in with the employers and politicians who fight government regulations and workers' collective bargaining. They strive to steal workers' freedom and dignity, all in the name of their own freedom. Part of this effort benefits from or fosters processes of families and communities forgetting or diminishing the significance of the workplace struggles and traumas in their own pasts.</p>
<p>Fortunately, good governance and organized labor seem to be making a comeback.</p>

			 <p>Michael Bohnert, an engineer at Rand Corporation, shares some useful insights about electronic warfare in the August 16, 2024 episode of the podcast <a href="https://shows.acast.com/ukraine-the-latest">Ukraine the Latest</a>. He discusses this topic in connection with Ukraine&rsquo;s Kursk incursion and describes the difficult choices that Russia&rsquo;s political and military leadership face in the coming months from the standpoint of electronic warfare.</p>
<p>Also, Anders Puck Nielsen, a military analyst in Denmark, released a helpful 15-minute video on YouTube today about where he thinks Russia&rsquo;s leadership is in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_80rUKItGc">responding to Ukraine&rsquo;s incursion</a>. Acknowledging complexity, he nonetheless keeps his viewers' eyes on two fundamental issues for Russia, namely, space and manpower, and he underlines the critical domestic political entanglements that the manpower question has.</p>
<p>Both of these contributions offer useful perspectives on Ukraine&rsquo;s shakeup of a common impression that the conflict was supposedly frozen. Of course, there are many more aspects of this story, but I highlight these contributions because I haven&rsquo;t seen them in other news stories so far.</p>

			 <p>In <em>This is Not Propaganda</em> (end of part 2), Peter Pomerantsev writes of his Russian family, based in Kyiv, becoming stateless in the late 1970s. The KGB had accused his father, Igor, of &ldquo;circulating defamatory fabrications, regular listening to hostile broadcasts and contacts with foreigners.&rdquo; They recommended he emigrate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In many ways Igor was lucky. He had the semblance of choice. The [KGB] major had made it clear that if he stayed, he would have the full seven years in prison and five exiled in the Soviet provinces to face. If he had been a Ukrainian-language poet, [Pomerantsev continues, Igor] would have been locked up immediately. Repression in Ukraine focused on exterminating any signs of independent Ukrainian culture outside the cultural crèche of state-sanctioned Soviet &lsquo;Ukrainianness&rsquo;. But Igor wrote in Russian, the language of the coloniser.</p>

			 <p>Lawrence O’Donnell had some tough words for his media colleagues yesterday on MSNBC. Journalists pretended to ask questions at a supposed news conference, broadcast live, while Trump pretended he was answering them. Throughout the charade, they gave him and his torrent of semi-coherent lies a pass, like they always do, most fatefully in 2016. Then O&rsquo;Donnell showed a longer segment by the one candidate who actually had something to say yesterday, but whose talk had not been deemed worthy of a live broadcast on any network: Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>The vice president spoke to the United Auto Workers in Detroit. Her message was not a simple repeat of her Philadelphia speech the day before. In this smaller, more focused setting, she talked about the importance of collective bargaining for achieving a fair result. What&rsquo;s more, she tied the term &ldquo;collective&rdquo; as used in an organized labour context to the community theme that figured so prominently in her Philadelphia speech. She linked the hard work of collective bargaining and of organizing politically to love of country, and she spoke of the dignity of labor.</p>
<p>Fairness and dignity. That&rsquo;s a message Americans need to hear about. What they got, instead, was an impotent rehash of the same old resentments, lies, and insecurities. I&rsquo;m not much for television news and opinion, but this 25-minute video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD-oTJ49nls">available on YouTube</a>) is important. Broadcast and print media, take note. Your country deserves better.</p>

			 <p>There are two documentary films streaming on Paramount+ right now that I find inspiring and motivating: &ldquo;Superpower&rdquo; (2023), directed by Sean Penn and Aaron Kaufman; and &ldquo;Kiss the Future&rdquo; (2024), directed by Nenad Cicin-Sain. The first centers on Ukraine and Volodymyr Zelinsky in Russia&rsquo;s current war against Ukraine, and the second goes back to the Siege of Sarajevo (1992–96).</p>
<p>A theme common to each film is ordinary citizens standing up to genocidal aggressors. There is also the relationship between popular culture and politics in war, including the role of international celebrity. In the first movie, an entertainer-turned-president must lead a country in war, supported by a self-mobilizing citizenry. Moreover, one of the directors is himself an entertainer. In the second movie, inhabitants of a city under constant fire find a way to get by and even thrive with punk rock and dance. They are later joined on TV and then in person by the band U2.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Forms of Delirium&rdquo; is the third act of Peter Pomerantsev, <em>Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia</em> (New York: PublicAffairs, 2014). Now deep in the section titled &ldquo;A Brief History of Sects in Post-Soviet Russia,&rdquo; it dawns on me that this material provides useful context for the bizarre, messianic, wartime rhetoric I&rsquo;ve heard come out of Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov&rsquo;s mouth in the <a href="https://m.youtube.com/@russianmediamonitor" title="Russian Media Monitor on YouTube">television clips</a> that Julia Davis translates for English-speaking audiences.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Solovyov necessarily believes all the poison he spews. The first act of the same book, &ldquo;Reality Show Russia,&rdquo; provides plenty of background on that subject, even if it is based on prewar Russia. Still, the combination of mysticism, religion, ethnic Russian nationalism, and ostensibly anti-imperialist imperialism dripping from parts of the final act of this excellent book offers at least some reason for not dismissing a talking head like Solovyov out of hand. He may use the privilege of the fool to say extreme things, but he knows his words are landing.</p>

			 <p>In a TAZ editorial, Carolina Schwarz observes a recent round of German organizations finally leaving Twitter. She argues that organizations who have been fighting to preserve the space that once was Twitter should <a href="https://taz.de/!6014969/" title="Deutsche Organisationen verlassen X: Haut endlich ab!">give it up</a>. Doing so will render it irrelevant.</p>
<p>I would add that public facing organizations and individuals need to get over their addiction to the misleading follower numbers on xitter (pronounce &ldquo;x&rdquo; with an &ldquo;sh&rdquo; sound) and learn how to navigate and help shape the open social media spaces in the Fediverse and the Fediverse-adjacent Bluesky. Public and publicly funded organizations in particular have a duty to make their communications accessible on open social platforms, even if they want to maintain a presence in the siloed spaces too.</p>
<p>In fact, I no longer bother following institutions, organizations, and publications not on an open social media platform or offering reliable RSS or JSON feeds. There&rsquo;s more than enough to learn in this world without relying on wealthy, would-be gatekeepers of content they did not create.</p>

			 <p>In Thursday&rsquo;s <em>Hareetz</em>, Ofer Aderet offers some <a href="https://archive.ph/gA8Rs">useful background</a> on the exemption of yeshiva students from military service. In 1948, there were only some 400 yeshiva students. Preserving their schools seemed a priority in the wake of the destruction of so much Jewish learning. The exemption was supposed to be temporary, but it still exists. Nowadays, there are more than 60,000 yeshiva students, and the religious and cultural situation of 1948 improved decades ago. Given Israel&rsquo;s current security situation, there is enormous societal pressure to make the burden of mandatory military service equitable. The current government, which includes ultra-Orthodox Jews, has avoided doing so, but the High Court of Justice ruled it has to. John Strawson talks about <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-will-israels-bombshell-court-ruling-that-haredi-jews-must-serve-in-the-military-mean-for-netanyahu-expert-qanda-233460">what this means for Netanyahu</a> in a question-and-answer piece in <em>The Conversation</em>. This second piece assumes less background knowledge on the part of the reader, while also going a bit deeper into the current political context.</p>
<p><em>Links to developments closer to home:</em> Conscription, what Americans call &ldquo;the draft,&rdquo; is a powerful tool for war, but it requires a broad political consensus about the justness of the war and a sense that conscription&rsquo;s implementation is fair. The U.S. Army and its political masters learned this lesson the hard way during the Vietnam War, after which the country moved to a volunteer force. By contrast, the Federal Republic of Germany held onto conscription until 2011 because its political leadership valued the link between military service and citizenship, a liberal tradition with roots in nineteenth-century political, military, and constitutional developments. Conscription is still in the country&rsquo;s Basic Law, but the number of people being called up made conscription inequitable and therefore untenable, at least during a time when a major war in Europe no longer seemed likely.</p>

<p>Air raids were a new danger in the Great War, and people within range of enemy aircraft needed to know what to do. The main caption of this related instructional poster reads, &ldquo;How should I behave during an air raid?&rdquo; Five captioned cartoons in the top row show what <em>not</em> to do. Below each of these is the recommended life-saving response.</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Get away from the window! Curiosity is death!&rdquo; The sketch shows a terror- or awe-stricken family looking out, many mouths wide open. Instead of gawking, the poster commands readers, &ldquo;Stand individually behind pillars!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Never remain standing on an exposed road!&rdquo; &ldquo;Always seek cover!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stand behind the door!&rdquo; This is followed by more advice about strong pillars or load-bearing sections of the wall.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Panic is worse than an air raid!&rdquo; Pictured are people hurrying down the stairs, one person holding a candle, another an oil lamp. Underfoot is a small child who has fallen down, and ahead of these residents is an old man with a cane, about to be trampled. Instead of panicking, the readers are told, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about an attack at night!&rdquo; Pictured is a man under a duvet sleeping soundly.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Never stand in the middle of the room!&rdquo; The picture below this final warning shows a domestic space in which a man in bare feet and a nightshirt has behaved correctly: He is standing in a corner, an empty bed nearby, but the middle of his floor has disappeared.</li>
</ol>
<p>The apparent repetition and contradiction in this anonymously produced poster suggest that the poster was less a product of foresight and more an ad hoc response to recent events or rumors.</p>

			 <p>I found a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020427061139/http://homepage.mac.com/markstoneman">2002 version</a> of my first website on the Wayback Machine. It&rsquo;s a copy they received from the web crawler Alexa Internet. (I don&rsquo;t think I even knew the Internet Archive existed back then.) I wrote the simple HTML, probably with BBEdit Lite, and posted it to the iDisk account I had with Apple. The interesting part about the site for me now is the collection of teaching links I placed on one page. Back then, however, I only indicated its presence with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070104222008/http://homepage.mac.com/markstoneman/links.html">links</a> in a small font size in the footer.</p>
<p>Soon after, I used Dreamweaver to create a more involved website, but not much of that effort has survived. Here&rsquo;s a welcome page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030803044644/http://homepage.mac.com/markstoneman/">from 2003</a> without the CSS and scripts. I didn&rsquo;t keep up the Dreamweaver approach because it was far too involved for my purposes.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080103033202/http://homepage.mac.com/markstoneman/index.html">By 2006</a>, at the latest, it seems I had learned to not use tables, but I have no idea why. After all, touch screen phones were not a thing yet.</p>
<p>Later the site evolved into a wiki, which I produced by simply exporting a VoodooPad wiki to a folder of HTML files using VoodooPad&rsquo;s built-in functionality. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080426211003/http://homepage.mac.com/markstoneman/">version from 2008</a>. Unfortunately, not all of it was archived, and I suspect not all of my VoodooPad files have survived either.</p>
<p>The previous 2008 link leads to a page that lists blogs I have long since <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2012/01/22/another-fresh-start.html">discontinued</a>. The stuff I did on Blogger was not crawled and archived (maybe because Google wasn&rsquo;t sharing its crawling the way Alexa did?). By contrast, some parts of my old WordPress and Tumblr sites seem to have been archived, though usually no more than a couple pages at a time. That said, I already integrated some of those posts into this iteration of my site.</p>
<p>When Apple announced it was closing down iDisk in 2012, I bought my domain and turned one of my WordPress blogs into my main home. Gone was my simple Wiki. VoodooPad never transitioned successfully to iOS anyway, and its new owner has had a hard time keeping up the pace of development. People complain about subscription models, but their absence can lead to the death of beloved apps.</p>
<p>My engagement on Twitter accompanied much of this activity. Some people gave up on blogging completely as a consequence of that platform. l&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>Death, destruction, refugeehood, humanitarian crises – those are the things we&rsquo;re used to accepting as part of the reality of war&hellip; But in Gaza I also saw the death of the human soul. The Gazans are zombies. Death of souls on that scale, psychological wreckage at that level, I&rsquo;ve never seen anywhere. At a certain point, I went through Rafah, and the streets were filled with refugee tents, and people, and booths, and there were hardly any vehicles, because there&rsquo;s no fuel, so transportation is via carts and donkeys, and people move between them slowly. It took us two hours to cover a distance that normally would take 10 minutes. And all this time I looked at the faces of the people who were passing by us and I was shocked because they just looked dead.</p>

			 <p>The main reason I stuck with Bear.app for many years was the nesting tags feature. But Drafts.app has had that for some time too, so what is the point of Bear for me? The web content saving features aren&rsquo;t for me either because I&rsquo;ve got DEVONthink, which these days plays nicely on my iPad too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve postponed this decision several times because Bear is usually so reliable and easy, but no more. I could live with the recent unnecessary features it was cramming in, but the upgrade to Bear 2 or 2.2 seems to have made it susceptible to crashes. After experiencing that and an unpleasant support interaction, I had one foot out the door. Then I learned that the only regular backup option outside of the practical iCloud syncing was <em>manual</em>. And there was no versioning of individual notes. Both feet out the door now.</p>
<p>One very good thing about Bear is the ease with which one can move data in and out of it.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/19/arts/harlem-renaissance-librarians-libraries-books-literature.html">&ldquo;How Black Librarians Helped Create Generations of Black Literature&rdquo;</a> by Jennifer Schuessler, <em>The New York Times</em>, June 19, 2024.</p>
<p>This is a fascinating short history that references the scholars whose work the cultural reporter draws on.</p>
<p>Teaser: &ldquo;Recent scholarship is uncovering the role of the women who ran libraries during the Harlem Renaissance where they built collections and, just as important, communities of writers and readers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agents of change: The necessary activism required of librarians in oppressive contexts will sound familiar to people today in the context of bans related to race and sexuality. For example, the only significant collection in the Jim Crow South was in Roanoke, Virginia. When the librarian there, Virginia Lee, was eventually told to get rid of the books, she moved them to the basement instead and continued to discretely circulate them.</p>
<p>Knowledge formation: The seemingly banal work of collection, classification, and organization required the creation of new knowledge. For instance, cataloging using the Dewey scheme required the addition of new subjects because that system only foresaw shelving Black-authored and Black-themed books in two limited spaces: under the headings of &ldquo;slavery&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Negro question,&rdquo; the latter a subset of &ldquo;colonization and migration.&rdquo; Dorothy Porter added entirely new categories, including for slave insurrections, the blues, and passing. She also reorganized American political history by situating presidents in topics important to Black readers. Andrew Johnson&rsquo;s tenure was filed under &ldquo;emancipation&rdquo; and Rutherford B. Hayes under &ldquo;Ku Klux Klan&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Knowledge, culture, and sociability: This article has some wonderful photographs, including of the women in groups.</p>
<p>Addendum: The New York Public Library and, within it, The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture have digitized some of their materials. That&rsquo;s where I found a powerful pastel by Morris Schulman titled <a href="https://historyofknowledge.hypotheses.org/2017/09/08/writing-lesson/">&ldquo;The Writing Lesson&rdquo;</a>.</p>

			 <p>I just saw images in <em>The Telegraph</em> of <a href="https://archive.ph/N30QQ">emaciated Ukrainian POWs</a> recently traded back from Russia. These stark images were taken after the men had regained some 10 kilograms of their lost weight. If you look closely, you&rsquo;ll actually see life in the photographed eyes. How did the same eyes and severely weakened bodies look before the exchange?</p>
<p>Starved and no contact with the International Red Cross&mdash;I&rsquo;m trying to grasp what this intentionally extreme mistreatment means. After all, the Ukrainians are holding Russians. As far as I know, food as such is not in short supply in Russia. Was this the result of extreme mistreatment in one location? Or was it more widespread, systematic? Was it about torture with specific mission-related objectives? Was it zeal, resentment, sadism, corruption, indifference? Will this have any impact on Russian POWs in Ukraine? Or will Ukraine&rsquo;s leadership continue striving to keep the higher ground?</p>

</ul>
<p>Anshel Pfeffer&rsquo;s analysis draws on the time-tested framework of civil-military relations. First and foremost, there is the conflict between the prime minister and his generals. Netanyahu is right to insist on the primacy of civilian political control of the army, but he has apparently never learned the value of taking counsel from his generals. Worse, he is resorting to using a stab-in-the-back conspiracy theory about the generals. People familiar with fascist takeovers will get very uncomfortable with this rhetoric.</p>
<p>Besides the conflict between the civilian and military leadership, there is the army itself, the IDF, whose ranks include conscripts and men and women called back because of their obligations in the reserves. There might be people who escape military service in Israel, but its army is more closely linked to civilian society than any in countries that use all-volunteer professional militaries. That places limits on how irresponsibly it can be used.</p>
<p>Then there is the mess of a war itself. Setting aside the humanitarian crisis and how the atrocities will scar the soldiers called to perpetrate them, there is the prime minister&rsquo;s narrow strategic vision. He and his government know how to order killing, but they have apparently forgotten how asymmetrical warfare works. That, or they think such conflict requires more blood&mdash;an attitude that fits very well with the aggrieved mentalities of stab-in-the-back &ldquo;victims&rdquo; (read: leaders in need of scapegoats to take the blame off themselves). In any case, Amos Harel&rsquo;s focus on certain military details&mdash;from the fighting in Gaza to the growing threat posed by Hezbollah in the north&mdash;reads well with the other article. Taken together, they show a fraught mess largely of Netanyahu&rsquo;s own making.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve started importing photos from my Instagram page to Pixelfed, a Fediverse alternative. The process is still ongoing, but the results look good so far. I skipped comments because moving those out of context doesn&rsquo;t feel right, but the text I originally included with the posts is still there.</p>
<p>I only began using this Instagram account in the pre-vaccination phase of the pandemic. It was after working with Levke Harders on her piece called <a href="https://historyofknowledge.hypotheses.org/2020/09/16/social-media/">&ldquo;Social Media as a Distinct Form of Knowledge Production,&quot;</a> in which she included some discussion about academic Instagram. I wanted to see what was even possible in that context. But it was hard to get into Instagram because of its excessive advertising, suggested posts I never asked for, and follow-spam from scammers. I&rsquo;ve also never loved the absence of an iPad app and third-party app alternatives. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind leaving the place entirely; however, as with Facebook, it&rsquo;s my only connection to some people, especially post-Twitter.</p>
<p>I still share a little there, but only if it&rsquo;s something specific I&rsquo;d like people there to see. Even then, <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/08/visited-facebook-last.html">Meta&rsquo;s algorithm might have other ideas</a>. Instagram makes sharing inconvenient, anyway. It wants you to post there first, whether with its app or its website. Sharing from there to other places is possible, but posting to there from other sources not, unless you&rsquo;re one of their business clients. (Facebook is handled a bit differently, but I&rsquo;ve given up trying to pay attention to Meta&rsquo;s latest gimmicks in human engineering.)</p>
<p>Pixelfed is nice. I&rsquo;m not sure how well it will work as social media for me because I haven&rsquo;t yet been social on it. In any case, it integrates well with Mastodon. I also wonder about the 4 GB storage limit on my instance, Pixelfed.de, but that has to be plenty for the time being. Besides, nothing is locked in the platform or in that instance of the platform. It&rsquo;s the independent web.</p>

</ul>
<p>I still need to process this report, but its outline already lines up with the reporting presented in the prize-winning Frontline/AP documentary, &ldquo;20 Days in Mariupol&rdquo; (<a href="https://archive.org/details/youtube-gvAyykRvPBo">available in full on the Internet Archive</a>). Its chapters include:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Attacks on Objects Indispensable to the Survival (OIS) of the Civilian Population&rdquo;;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Denial of Humanitarian Aid&rdquo;;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Denial of Humanitarian Evacuations and Filtration&rdquo;; and</li>
<li>&ldquo;Arrest and Persecution of Humanitarian Volunteers.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>At the very least, Russia&rsquo;s systematic actions make one thing even more abundantly clear: Russia&rsquo;s invasion never had anything even remotely to do with &ldquo;protecting&rdquo; Russian speakers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also trying to grasp what Russia&rsquo;s actions mean to Ukrainians already keenly aware of Stalin&rsquo;s instrumentalization of hunger and famine against them.</p>
<p>Finally, it is interesting to see this report come out at a time when Israel&rsquo;s government has been deliberately starving Palestinians in Gaza. There are many past precedents for applying such methods in war, but the international humanitarian movement and international humanitarian law have been making significant strides. Public denials of starvation charges by perpetrators only underline their awareness of this reality.</p>

			 <p>Aryeh Neier, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2024/06/06/is-israel-committing-genocide-aryeh-neier/">Is Israel Committing Genocide?</a>,&rdquo; <em>The New York Review of Books</em>, June 6, 2024.</p>
<p>The author, who has seen much as one of the founders of Human Rights Watch, has long been &ldquo;sparing&rdquo; in his application of the term &ldquo;genocide&rdquo; to state-committed atrocities over the past several decades. Initially he did not think of Israel&rsquo;s indiscriminate, even criminal violence against civilians as genocide, because Israel had a clear right to defend itself against the barbarous acts of Hamas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am now persuaded that Israel is engaged in genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. What has changed my mind is its sustained policy of obstructing the movement of humanitarian assistance into the territory.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What makes this specific article a good read is that he embeds his brief account of the current war into a broad framework of (1) violent conflicts outside of this one, (2) international discourses and agreements about humanity and law in war, and (3) the development of international humanitarian law. Of the last, he writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These efforts, which reflected the growing strength and capacity of the human rights movement, created public awareness of IHL and helped to establish the context in which a conflict such as the war in Gaza is being judged by concerned members of the public worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neier ends the piece with the establishment of courts to prosecute war crimes and crimes against international humanitarian law. He very briefly considers their relevance to the war in Gaza. Of course, Netanyahu cares little about international opinion or rules. The prime minister invokes &ldquo;antisemitism&rdquo; because it suits his current objectives.</p>
<p>Working against his methods is another fact that world leaders ignore at their own peril, it seems to me. As Neier writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been engaged in efforts to protect human rights for more than six decades, often in circumstances with exceedingly high stakes. I cannot recall any dispute over rights that aroused greater passions and more debate than that involving the war in Gaza since October 7.</p>

<p>Teaser: &ldquo;Last October, Palestinian students and academic staff in Israel faced unprecedented penalties for their speech. Now the repression persists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Takeaway: This piece shows just how far academic institutions in Israel have been willing to go in order to serve the state&rsquo;s goals at the expense of academic freedom, free speech, and the rule of law.</p>
<p>Question: How are universities governed in Israel? How vulnerable are they to outside political pressure under less fraught conditions? I am wondering about the political effects of Israel&rsquo;s extreme right-wing government, on one hand, and the broad effects of the current wartime climate, on the other.</p>

			 <p>The transition from Wordpress.com to Micro.blog was challenging because of the initial difficulty I had in finding and customizing a theme that worked for me. They either did not feel right to me, or I couldn&rsquo;t find sufficient documentation. This problem was multiplied by insufficient knowledge about Hugo (the blogging software) and Go (the language Hugo uses).</p>
<p>I initially passed over Tiny Theme because I did not appreciate its developer&rsquo;s approach, but pouring through the Micro.blog help forums led me to try it again. Armed with a little more knowledge, I began to appreciate what the theme offers.</p>
<p>Tiny Theme is the best-documented theme on Micro.blog. Besides the <a href="https://github.com/MattSLangford/Tiny-Theme-for-Micro.blog">Git page</a>, its creator, <a href="https://mattlangford.com">Matt Langford</a> has a dedicated <a href="https://tiny.micro.blog">Tiny Theme site</a>, written in plain language that assumes some knowledge of blogging and markup, but not overly much.</p>
<p>Matt also generously answers questions, but do your research first&mdash;both as a common courtesy and so you understand his answers.</p>
<p>I think his &ldquo;leave a tip link&rdquo; recalls the great tradition of shareware, which Apple&rsquo;s app store has undermined in the MacOS world. Why not honor his work and keep such a tradition alive at the same time?</p>
<h3 id="future-proofing">Future-Proofing</h3>
<p>The theme is built to be adaptable without changes requiring too many interventions in its core templates. One can still edit those, but Matt wrote the templates to look for a user&rsquo;s customizations in files called microhooks. This makes updating the theme much easier.</p>
<p>Update-proofing matters because Matt regularly maintains and updates the theme (in useful ways, not ways that require you to rethink everything).</p>
<p>In this respect, it is better to use your Micro.blog custom CSS page than to change the theme&rsquo;s CSS directly.</p>
<p>This last point about CSS is critical for making a move to another theme possible. A lot of CSS customizations are specific to a theme, but you have some that are not theme-specific, e.g., <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/12/small-image-galleries.html">small image galleries</a>.</p>
<p>If you customize one of the theme&rsquo;s core templates (as opposed to the microhooks you write from scratch), write down what you did. You will need this information later. See below for your own customizations.</p>
<h3 id="updating-tiny-theme">Updating Tiny Theme</h3>
<p>⚠️ When you see an update is available in Micro.blog&rsquo;s plugins UI (where the themes are stored), do not hit the update button. Instead, first go to Github to see which files have changed. (It&rsquo;s an easier UI for scanning modification dates.) Make a note of their names. Then hit the update button in the pugins UI.</p>
<p>⛔️ Never click the 🔄 button on the Micro.blog theme management page. Despite its emoji, it does <strong>not</strong> sync your files. It just downloads from the Github repository and overwrites your customized files, except the microhooks. You don&rsquo;t need this functionality,</p>
<p>After that, your theme files in Micro.blog&rsquo;s theme editing UI (menu item: Design) will all still be intact. Below that section are the unedited theme files. If you have modified any of the files that that were updated, see the next step. Otherwise you&rsquo;re done (except to eyeball your blog for any apparent issues).</p>
<p>Assuming you have taken notes on your modifications to any of the theme&rsquo;s templates that were updated, you first delete these modified files from the customization section, and then you modify and save the same changes in the section that holds the themes unmodified files. As soon as you do that, Micro.blog saves the file you your customized templates and restores the original template to the theme files section.</p>
<p>This setup relates to the lookup order of Micro.blog&rsquo;s Hugo rendering engine: It first looks if the necessary template is among the customized files. If it finds it, that&rsquo;s the one it uses to output that (part of the) page . If not, it looks to the original theme files. (If here either, it looks to Micro.blog&rsquo;s default files.)</p>
<h3 id="my-modifications">My Modifications</h3>
<p>This section does not include the microhooks, since the theme doesn&rsquo;t touch their contents.</p>
<h4 id="layouts_defaultlisthtml">layouts/_default/list.html</h4>
<p>This file renders category pages on Micro.blog. I merely added &ldquo;Category: &quot; before the page title (the category name) in the following block.</p>
<p><code>&lt;h2 class=&quot;p-name&quot;&gt;Category: {{ .Title }}&lt;/h2&gt;</code></p>
<h4 id="layouts_defaultlistarchivehtmlhtml">layouts/_default/list.archivehtml.html</h4>
<p>This is the template renders the archive page on Micro.blog, if you have enabled the page in Micro.blog&rsquo;s UI.</p>
<p>Main issues with Tiny Theme default:</p>
<ol>
<li>The categories are not alphabetized.</li>
<li>The categories render as a long vertical list.</li>
</ol>
<p>I needed alphabetical order and a format that worked better for all my categories than a vertical unordered list. (I have a lot of categories because Micro.blog is only set up for categories, not categories and tags.)</p>
<p>Tiny Theme has a microhook to add introductory material to the archive page, so that bit is not at issue here.</p>
<h4 id="original-section-section-of-this-theme-page">Original section section of this theme page</h4>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;div class=&quot;archive-categories&quot;&gt;

{{ end }}
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ end }}
</code></pre><h4 id="modified-section">Modified section</h4>
<p>I was able to get most of the following by copying and pasting from a file in the notes of a short YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un4vw1QscsY">video by Vlad Campos</a>. I fooled around a lot with it,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but I think I ended up just replacing the span tags with paragraph tags, which seems to have made CSS styling possible. (The indentation differences between this section and the original make no difference to Hugo, as far as I can tell.)</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;div class=&quot;archive-categories&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Categories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
{{ $sortedList := sort $list &quot;Title&quot; }}

{{ range $index, $element := $sortedList }}
&lt;a href=&quot;{{ $element.Permalink }}&quot;&gt;{{ $element.Title }}&lt;/a&gt; {{ if lt $index (sub $length 1) }}{{ end }} 
{{ end }} 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ end }}
</code></pre><h4 id="update-oct-10-2024-additional-modifications-to-archive-page-template">Update (Oct. 10, 2024): Additional Modifications to Archive Page Template</h4>
<p>Change the <code>&lt;p class=&quot;h-entry&quot;&gt;</code> block to the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;p class=&quot;h-entry&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;{{ .Permalink }}&quot; class=&quot;u-url&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dt-published&quot; datetime=&quot;{{ .Date.Format &quot;2006-01-02T15:04:05-0700&quot; }}&quot;&gt;{{ .Date.Format &quot;Jan 2, 2006&quot; }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - 
{{ if .Title }}
&lt;a href=&quot;{{ .Permalink }}&quot; class=&quot;u-url&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-name&quot;&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
{{else}}
&lt;span class=&quot;p-summary&quot;&gt;{{ .Summary | truncate 140 }}&lt;/span&gt;
{{end}}
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre><p>This changes the bold titles to normal font weight while also adding links to the titles. It also removes summaries from posts that have titles and truncates untitled posts at 140 characters.</p>

			 <h3 id="my-history-with-wordpresscom">My history with WordPress.com</h3>
<ul>
<li>Began with free version, ca. 2007; was an improvement over Blogger (by then owned by Google).</li>
<li>Ads become too obtrusive, so paid to remove them.</li>
<li>Began using site not only to blog, but also as a professional signboard.</li>
<li>Eventually upgraded to business plan to meet customization needs (add plugins).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Made site usable for course materials (behind password) because setting up courses on Blackboard was crazy time-consuming, especially for an adjunct professor who couldn&rsquo;t get into any routine. (And Blackboard was unreliable.)
<ul>
<li>Continued to use site for blog and professional signboard. Expensive, but support always available via chat. Well worth it, especially now that I had a regular salary (editor, GHI).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Switch to freelance in 2020 required a whole new set up. I accomplished this by modifying one of their templates.</li>
<li>Within about 18 months, this site broke. WordPress.com declared the theme I was using deprecated &ndash; with no warning.</li>
<li>Started over, but stayed on WordPress.com because of my elder care responsibilities (my father&rsquo;s last several months alive).</li>
<li>WordPress.com all in on its block themed UI, so I  did it that way. Took a lot of extra work, and a new issue arose: page load times.
<ul>
<li>Search engine rankings were now taking these into account, and these block themes seemed to be monsters. Extensions needed to optimize images, CSS, scripts.</li>
<li>Automattic&rsquo;s Jetpack CDN was not all that fast. Needed to add Cloudflare to the mix for that and more control over caching.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Such a setup required constant attention, and WordPress.com&rsquo;s online customer support degraded: longer wait times, maybe no chat at all, longer email response times, if such were needed, and so on. To add insult to injury, they started selling expensive website optimization add-ons for problems they themselves were creating.</li>
<li>Before I let the site renew, I looked for a system that produced static pages because they load faster than a dynamic platform like WordPress, which builds pages on the fly.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be possible to render static pages on my own computer with Hugo (or related) and then host these pages on Github or Cloudflare. Assuming modest traffic, this might even be free. But the learning curve. Hugo is powerful, but it&rsquo;s command-line only. I didn&rsquo;t have time before my other set-up had expired. Command line is doable for simpler tasks, but I&rsquo;ve found that tools like these are generally written for others already at home in this environment. The documentation tends to have a high bar of entry.</p>
<h3 id="choosing-microblog">Choosing Micro.blog</h3>
<ul>
<li>Micro.blog, which uses the Hugo engine, started to look attractive. Its web UI is quirky; its documentation is incomplete; and its Mac and iOS apps don&rsquo;t offer feature parity. Its underlying ethos, however, works for me: It wants average users to be able to work with its tools. At the same time, it offers ways to customize things, even if these options tend to presuppose a lot more prior knowledge.</li>
<li>Micro.blog is definitely not as easy as Blogger and WordPress were in the aughts, if you need to customize things. Once you get things running, though, you can write in Markdown, which humans can easily write and read. It&rsquo;s easy to post from any computer or mobile device, including my phone. (WordPress had made that increasingly difficult.)</li>
<li>Micro.blog has its own social network, which I was not interested in, especially not in the wake of Twitter&rsquo;s murder and the ensuing platform fatigue (and I had come to Twitter after another platform imploded). But Micro.blog&rsquo;s network and the blogs it hosts are built so one can participate in the IndieWeb. One can pull one&rsquo;s content from elsewhere, syndicate the content of one&rsquo;s hosted blog, and so on. Even some replies can travel beyond a single platform or website.</li>
<li>There has been a learning curve for me, but it has solved not only my blog-hosting problem, but also offered me additional <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2023/09/19/juggling-social-media.html%20title=%22Juggling%20Social%20Media%20Platforms%22">options in this post-twitter world</a>.</li>
<li>Given the Fediverse context (which decentralizes comment moderation and involves many more people in the process, in relative terms), I&rsquo;ve even felt able to <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/03/comments-back-on.html">turn comments back on</a></li>
<li>And I&rsquo;ve seen the point of bringing back a <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/02/bringing-back-a.html">blogroll</a>.</li>
<li>Bonus point: there hasn&rsquo;t been any need to set up GDPR cookie notices, which were very necessary on WordPress.com (a self-hosted WordPress blog can be privacy friendlier, provided you have the know-how). I still need a <a href="https://markstoneman.com/privacy-notice/">privacy notice</a>, but it&rsquo;s much simpler now, especially since I also removed YouTube embeds.</li>

			 <p>The following post appeared in my Mastodon timeline this morning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of today, MacStories is disallowing all known AI crawlers, including ChatGPT and Applebot. If you want to read our site, you should use a web browser or RSS.<br>
✌️<br>
<cite><a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/112609519691842609">Federico Viticci, June 13, 2023</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pronouncement could, indeed, <em>is</em> being made by countless others who run independent websites. Questions and anxiety abound, but we are nowhere close to fashioning responses adequate to the current moment. A visceral sense of violation, of wrong, is hitting many of us, who have long since had enough of Silicon Valley, Madison Avenue, and all the rest treating the traces we leave online as a natural resource to extract value from. Yesterday, the above-quoted observer on Mastodon <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/112606317077490324#">reported</a>, &ldquo;I was grossed out when I read that Applebot scraped &lsquo;the open web&rsquo; to train their AI model&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>My most immediate question about his no-AIs-on-MacStories statement was <em>how?</em> How you are working to keep <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLMs</a> from feasting on your site? Take the robots.txt file: Are there settings that allow search engines to index pages while instructing those same search engines that their LLM activities are not welcome? How do you cover all known LLMs and related scraping activities in a meaningful way? Aren&rsquo;t these things and their user numbers multiplying and mutating in ways that exceed our individual tracking abilities, not to mention <a href="https://www.searchenginecodex.com/proposing-a-new-meta-tag-for-llm-ai/" title="Dena Mason, 'Proposing A New Meta Tag For LLM/AI'">the limits</a> of what a robots.txt file can hold?</p>
<p>Alternatively, have you found a way to make copyright and licensing statements that these tools will understand and honor? I&rsquo;m trying meta tags, but I think only the first of the two below is standard:</p>
<p><code>&lt;meta name=&quot;author&quot; content=&quot;Mark R. Stoneman&quot;&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;meta name=&quot;license&quot; content=&quot;CC BY-NC-SA 4.0&quot;&gt;</code></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also using semantic tags to ensure my copyright and CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license statements in the footer are easily discoverable, but it all feels so provisional, so early-2000s-wild-west again. Only worse.</p>
<p>Moreover, the LLM challenge reaches beyond simple illegal copying, downloading, storage, and retrieval. These LLMs are being trained on our words, trained, it almost seems, by lurking in our conversations and learning. Their value proposition is that they will build something new on the basis of what already exists. Although this feels purely extractive (like Elsevier&rsquo;s contribution to academic publishing), how can such direct links between our individual output and that of the LLMs be established?</p>
<p>Perhaps we are mixing feelings and concepts in ways that do not necessarily apply to the current situation. To begin with, there is that sense of personal violation that many of us have long felt with respect to the trackers that Google and other marketing entities use without our permission. The European Union&rsquo;s <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">GDPR</a> is meant to address that problem for its citizenry, but the phenomenon of LLMs training on our language does not necessarily amount to an infringement of our data privacy&mdash;not if they are &ldquo;learning&rdquo; how to &ldquo;listen&rdquo; and &ldquo;talk&rdquo;, but not retaining data on our personal habits for later use. At the same time, this LLM scraping feels even creepier and more extractive than what advertising trackers were doing in the pre&ndash;LLM era.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to imagine how we can regain a sense of control over the things we publish on the internet. We need practical web standards and tools that give us choices that the big LLM players are willing to respect. We need metaphors that reach beyond copyright and privacy, when necessary, but that don&rsquo;t lead us to anthropomorphize the LLMs and their &ldquo;learning&rdquo;, thereby making the problem of so-called AI even worse. And we need jurisprudence that looks for ways to deal with our sense of violation that privacy laws and copyright alone do not seem adequate for. Meanwhile companies that use our linguistic existences to sell language-based LLM services back to us would do well to listen to their critics and adjust their activities accordingly. Wrapping up everything in pretty privacy policies and new feature hype will not be enough for them to thrive, although their deep pockets will help buy the legal frameworks they want, if we&rsquo;re not paying attention.</p>

			 <p class="callout"><small>New post format: notes written only for myself, but perhaps of interest to others.  Will file under a new <a href="https://markstoneman.com/categories/shared-notes">shared notes</a> category for now, while also using the blog's other relevant categories.</small></p>
<p>I ran into the term &ldquo;digital gardens&rdquo; on the 🦣  profile of <a href="https://pkm.social/@RDK">@RDK@pkm.social</a>, which I looked up because of a repost by <a href="https://indieapps.space/@drafts">@drafts@indieapps.space</a> of a piece on the latter&rsquo;s search functionality. RDK&rsquo;s whole website, <a href="https://justtext.net/">Just Text</a>, has a quirky feel that reminds me of some Micro.blog-hosted blogs. These have extra pages about stuff that matters to them, lists, photos, a Tweet archive, other collections of related content.</p>
<p>I did a web search and started with <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/">&ldquo;Digital gardens let you cultivate your own little bit of the internet&rdquo;</a> (short). And then <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">&ldquo;A Brief History &amp; Ethos of the Digital Garden -&quot;</a>(detailed, thoughtful) by Maggie Appleton. The approach draws a contrast to (micro)blogging, and in some cases might take the form of a wiki, as in <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/">Tom Critchlow. Move. Think. Create.</a></p>
<p>This last one reminds me of my early course websites and source reference pages. At some point in the early aughts, I produced everything on VoodooPad (MacOS) and simply exported it into static html files. These I uploaded to whatever cloud-sharing service Apple offered its users before iCloud. The personal wikis also make me think about readings I did later for an unfinished project,
<a href="https://markstoneman.com/2017/06/23/war-gender-and.html">&ldquo;War, Gender, and Nation in 19th-Century Europe&rdquo;</a>. All my notes were in an iOS wiki made with an app that is no longer available. I hope my export of that file survived my various digital moves since then.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there has to be a dichotomy between timelines and other forms of independent webby existence.  I believe in my war and gender project, I not only interlinked reading notes and topic pages but also a research journal. I need that chronology too because I learn that way. This last point became clear again this past month while moving web hosts and redoing my categories. Revisiting the old has me making connections and gaining insights.</p>
<p>But I also need communication, and I like the Indie Web&rsquo;s general outlook on that. References: indieweb.org, book.micro.blog.</p>
<p>A common theme in these various approaches to the web seems to be <em>intentionality</em>. Many of us practiced more of that in 2020–2021, during the worst of the pandemic. I find myself in need of that now, too, because of the major disruptions that continue to affect my life.</p>
<p>Possibly related: yesterday I was thinking that my <a href="https://markstoneman.com/portfolio/">portfolio</a>, organized for others, could also be accessed through short, related blog posts. Maybe the bridge could be this notes format.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t cross-post notes pages to any social accounts, unless one is relevant to a particular discussion.</p>
<p>Addition: I just ran across the website of Sarah Shotts via a query on Micro.blog&rsquo;s forum. Their <a href="https://www.sarahshotts.com/log">Artist&rsquo;s Log</a> page is subtitled &ldquo;A Commonplace Book and Curiosity Cabinet of My Creative Ecosystem.&rdquo; What a wonderful way to put it. This log is a menu item on a site that presents the artist&rsquo;s portfolio, books, and bio to the world.</p>

<p>Von Schock und Überraschung nach den gestrigen Wahlergebnissen lese ich auf Mastodon. Wirklich aber? Es gab ja in Deutschland das Ganze mit dem Kampf gegen die nötige Machtausübung des Staates während der schlimmsten Momente der Pandemie. Mangelndes Mitgefühl hat das schon gezeigt, und grosse Vertrauensverlust den Machtausübenden gegenüber. Vielleicht triftiger noch: wir in den USA kennen eine starke Affinität zwischen solchen Ansichten und rechtspopulistischem bzw. rechtsradikalem Gedankengut. Ich meine, daß diesen Zusammenhang öfters in Deutschland auch konstatiert wurde.</p>
<p>Ich denke auch etwa an 2015 und an &ndash; anders aber relevant &ndash; die schlimmen Angriffe auf ausländische Mitbürger kurz nach der Wende. Neuerdings gab us wieder das instinktive Weiterrücken der CDU/CSU Führung nach rechts, was ja nicht im Vakuum geschieht. Zu guter Letzt gibt es die Rückgratlosigkeit des Bundeskanzlers und einer Großzahl anderer Politiker, die die öffentliche Meinung lieber folgen als lenken zu versuchen. Mich sollte es eher überraschen, daß es Überraschung gibt, aber das kenn ich in den USA auch, wie viel vom vorher Erwähntem auch.</p>
<p>Es gibt zwei berühmten schwarzen Komiker hierzulande, die in einem Sketch nach der Wahl 2016 nur lachen konnten, weil sie sehr wohl wußten, dass der Rassismus weiterhin fluorierte. Wenn man Peacock in den USA hat, ist es wohl leicht zu finden. Sonst fällt mir leider nur <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHG0ezLiVGc" title="All (Vanessa Bayer, Aidy Bryant, Beck Bennett, Cecily Strong) but two friends (Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock) are surprised by Donald Trump's victory while watching the election results roll in.">YouTube</a> ein.</p>

			 <p>Max Boot on Threads <a href="https://www.threads.net/@maxboot/post/C762T_5uH_c">writes</a>, &ldquo;I really want Threads to take over from X which is broken. But this is discouraging.&rdquo; Setting aside the fact that he has 23,000 followers, I typed a hurried response because I just can&rsquo;t hear it anymore. Why do so many smart, media-savvy people refuse to understand what has happened in the social media space over the past two years? Maybe it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ve always understood Twitter as just another broadcast medium?</p>
<p>Here is my reply as is, warts and all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe people accustomed to huge followings need to rethink how they do social media. The days of one platform are gone. A lot of us you will want to reach will never be reachable on twitter. And many of us will not stay on threads if it does not actually federate or stop playing around with its algorithm in such an unhelpful way. Try Bluesky, and try encouraging people to set up algorithms that will discover news. Try setting up such algorithms yourself and spreading the word about them. 1/2</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Use tools that let you broadcast to multiple platforms. But also, stop thinking of such media as broadcast media. Go for quality interactions too. Doing so can have its own network effects. Besides, shouldn&rsquo;t your media organizations be setting up tools too, such as their own Mastodon instances, Bluesky algorithms for your benefit, etc. There will never again be a pre-Musk Twitter. And we need to stop relying on the mega rich to build our tools. 2/2</p>

			 <p>The IndieWeb approach is about owning your own content.

			 <p>I am wondering how Threads can really federate given what Meta is doing with user content and so-called AI. There&rsquo;s opt-out in Europe and no choice whatsoever in the United States. While both situations are bad, they are becoming known. But what about people on other Fediverse instances who casually interact with a Threads account? I wonder who&rsquo;s working harder right now to achieve federation, Threads' coders, their legal team, or their spin doctors? The doublespeak, selective listening, and tone-deafness in Adam Mosseri&rsquo;s posts are sometimes hard to overlook.</p>

			 <p>I just noticed that the <a href="/portfolio/history-of-knowledge-blogs/">History of Knowledge</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;About&rdquo; page has been rewritten to claim that the GHI&rsquo;s director conceived that project. I would tell the story somewhat differently, but the boss gets to tell the story the way she wants.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Besides, this version reinforces my impression that my co-editor and I did something good because this boss would never claim ownership of a dud.</p>
<p>In fact, the site is still thriving, and, remarkably, it&rsquo;s chugging along with the same old Penscratch theme from WordPress&rsquo;s pre&ndash;block theme era. In an academic culture focused on making the new, while ignoring the need to maintain what has already been built, this is also a win of sorts. And I rest easier knowing that the site is being regularly archived by the Wayback Machine. Regardless of a director&rsquo;s priorities and the institute&rsquo;s funding, this thing will continue to exist for quite a while.</p>
<p>I just wish the current team had a more modern understanding of social media. Staying on Twitter after 2022 has meant relegating any conversation with readers and contributors to a now siloed platform that countless scholars and concerned citizens have abandoned. Of course, this criticism presupposes a desire for conversation. I suspect, though, that social media is purely a broadcast medium for the current team, as it is for many organizations. After all, engagement takes time, which means financial and opportunity costs.</p>

			 <p>I activated a <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/02/bringing-back-a.html" title="The first was a blogroll.">second feature</a> on my Micro.blog-hosted site that I had turned off years ago while still on WordPress: Comments. They had become more trouble than they were worth, and there was always the once useful bird site, where real conversations could transpire. But those were different times.</p>
<p>In a moment of optimism, I have chosen to believe that the sign-in requirement with Mastodon, BluSky, or Micro.blog will reduce potential friction for me because I&rsquo;ve encountered a lot less of it on these federating platforms. But time will tell. Right now, I can unmark a problematic comment so it doesn&rsquo;t appear, but only after the comment is initially posted. (The developer behind Micro.blog is considering making prior-approval an option.) I also have the usual mute, block, and report options.</p>
<p>Next step: seeing what happens&mdash;and what I might still need to do&mdash;if I get any responses from other sites via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention">webmention</a>. I&rsquo;m definitely enjoying what the IndieWeb community makes possible, but I wish its tools and documentation were more accessible to non-programming folk.

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since I maintained a blogroll, but the poisoning of Twitter makes me think it&rsquo;s a good idea. I do not want my network to be owned by a random billionaire whose interests are at odds with community building and maintenance. I&rsquo;ve been slowly (re)connecting with people on other microblogging platforms, but it&rsquo;s time to begin making my own site social as well. That&rsquo;s why the <a href="/blogroll">blogroll</a> is back.</p>
<p>A couple first impressions: I&rsquo;m noticing fewer blogs among people I&rsquo;m following on Mastodon than I would have expected on Twitter some fifteen years ago, when microblogging was not yet so ubiquitous. There are plenty of websites as CVs and marketing tools (for books and speaking engagements), but not as many blogs per se. On the other hand, there is a ton of microblogging going on. It&rsquo;s possible that some of these accounts should find their way onto my blogroll&mdash;perhaps more personal blogs too. But baby steps.</p>
<p>For now, I want to curate a list that reflects the interests on display in my own blogging. This approach will not necessarily create social connections with those I list, but it should manifest socially contingent knowledge about other blogs that some readers might find useful. In other words, I&rsquo;m trying to offer some social or human-driven discovery as opposed to the stuff that algorithmically driven search engines and social media deliver.</p>

			 <p>I quit the old bird site <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2022/12/04/bye-bye-birdie/" title="Bye Bye Birdie">last December</a>, and I&rsquo;ve been a happy <a href="https://zirk.us/@markstoneman">Mastodon</a> user instead ever since. Nonetheless, I&rsquo;ve recently begun dalliances with <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mark.stoneman">Threads</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/markstoneman.com">Bluesky</a>. I&rsquo;m not looking for greener pastures, but I&rsquo;m curious about what&rsquo;s on offer now, and I want to find some of the people who I don&rsquo;t see on Mastodon. Juggling social media platforms is inconvenient, but seemingly unavoidable at this particular moment, as people search for new communities and rebuild parts of their old ones. It is a moment of flux, and such flux could very well be the new normal.</p>
<h3 id="the-twitter-that-was">The Twitter that Was</h3>
<p>Among the growing circles of people who have quit the place once called Twitter, discussions about the new platforms tend to occur in reference to the old place, if only implicitly. But characterizing that old place is not as straightforward as one might think. Before the recent ill-considered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/07/musk-rushes-out-new-twitter-logo-its-just-an-x-that-someone-tweeted-at-him/" title="Musk rushes out new Twitter logo—it’s just an X that someone tweeted at him">rebranding</a> to X, Twitter was already different things to different people, depending not only on individual preferences but also on Twitter&rsquo;s possibilities. Those changed a great deal over the platform&rsquo;s first fifteen years, evolving in a synergy between users and developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag">Hashtags</a> were first employed by users as a way to organize and find posts. They also became tools for community-building. (Katrina Gulliver started using #twitterstorians back when historians' numbers there were relatively modest, for example, and this enabled us to find each other.) Quote tweets arose from user efforts to editorialize about others' posts. And threads, multipart tweets known earlier as tweetstorms, helped make such bursts of text easier to read in the order intended by the author. As Twitter adopted or initiated such features, they assumed different roles in users' practices and expectations, depending not only on users' needs and preferences but also on when they first adopted Twitter.</p>
<p>In the early days, independent developers improved the Twitter experience with third-party mobile and desktop applications that offered features Twitter did not, or they implemented functionalities differently. It was also possible to follow what was happening by using an older internet protocol called RSS, the same thing one can still use to follow blogs and other sites in a newsreader (I use <a href="https://netnewswire.com" title="A free open-source Mac and iOS app">NetNewsWire</a>). And services emerged to let one stitch a series of posts into a single story. Blogging and other content management systems worked out ways to integrate users' activities with Twitter, and automation services such as IFTTT and Zapier made it possible to set up recipes that were triggered in the event of certain content. One could use a specific hashtag in a tweet, and that hashtag would trigger an IFTTT recipe to post the same thing on Facebook. There were also bots, little applications that could pull data from somewhere, including Twitter, and post to Twitter themselves, acting openly as bots or masquerading as real people. Coders created bots for fun and bots for good, but also bots that served grifters and the spread of disinformation.</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s open <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a> made this diverse range of activity and user experiences possible. Its now prohibitively priced API has meant the death of most third-party applications and services.</p>
<p>As people leave xitter, they are searching for different things and reacting to other platforms accordingly. They are first and foremost looking for people from their old network. But they are also looking for specific features, the kind that can help them to approximate their earlier experiences, or even improve on them.</p>
<h3 id="the-apps-i-use">The Apps I Use</h3>
<p>In my case, a crucial aspect of the features question is how well each platform dovetails with my established routines on the iPad and Mac. Specifically, I am interested in integration with third-party apps and services for composition, crossposting, and syndication. I also want good apps for the specific social media platforms I&rsquo;m on. And I want a choice in the matter, like I used to have with Twitter before Musk started to reshape his newly purchased realm into a walled-off dystopia.</p>
<p>I have come to like Mastodon so much in part because <a href="https://tapbots.com">Tapbots</a> was so fast to release and refine a Mastodon client called <strong>Ivory</strong> (iOS and Mac). Having used this small company’s excellent <a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> for at least a decade, I felt at home in Ivory right away, much more so than in the other Mastodon apps I tried.</p>
<p><a id="linky-2023"></a>Another helpful app that I have used for many years is <strong>Linky</strong> by <a href="https://pragmaticcode.com">Pragmatic Code</a>. An iOS app that is available through the system&rsquo;s share extension from within Safari, it lets me post a link and select the accompanying image or images I want. Adding <a href="https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/describe-content-images">alt text</a> to each image for those who use a <a href="https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-products/screen-readers">screen reader</a> is also easy. So is creating an image from selected text (a text shot) with the same text added automatically to the alt text. Linky works with other browsers too, but not for text shot creation.</p>
<p>In the old days, before Facebook sealed its platform off from third-party clients, I could post to the bird and face sites at the same time with Linky. Nowadays, we&rsquo;re down to Mastodon, although a beta release this month has added <a href="https://mastodon.social/@pragmaticcode/111001659389734215">support for Bluesky</a>. Threads support is currently not on the table because there is no public API for developers to work with.</p>
<p>Another iOS and Mac app that I have long used with social media is <strong><a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a></strong> by Agile Tortoise. Besides being a really good input device that makes working with text a breeze on a mobile device, it has all manner of actions to automate moving one&rsquo;s text to other apps. Using the system share menu, it is possible to move text anywhere, but its ability to post directly to a platform is currently limited to Mastodon.</p>
<p>I use three Mastodon actions in Drafts: one to post directly, one to post a thread of multiple numbered posts with a single click, and one that opens the post in an Ivory draft (handy for adding images and accompanying alt text). There are many more actions available, too, because Drafts has an active userbase that contributes to the actions in its <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com" title="Drafts Directory">directory</a>. In fact, if you know how to write scripts, you could probably create an action that posts directly to Bluesky because that platform, like Mastodon, is open-source, albeit with a different, less mature internet protocol.</p>
<h3 id="diversity-of-platforms">Diversity of Platforms</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s still early days in this post-xitter world, so I&rsquo;ll talk about the kinds of people I&rsquo;m finding and interactions I&rsquo;m having another time. Only one thing is already clear: Many of the academics I used to follow are happy with Mastodon, but they don&rsquo;t necessarily use the same tools I do. Many others are still hopping about, trying the different places, and sometimes even keeping xitter in the mix. Based on the behavior and comments I&rsquo;m seeing, I suspect there will no longer be a single, one-size-fits-all-in-countless-different-ways platform of the kind the old bird place had become. I&rsquo;m resigned to using more than one social media venue, as different people find the social media platforms that suit them best.</p>
<p>Besides, there must be people out there working on ways to read and post on multiple platforms from within the same application. It&rsquo;s too bad some social networking platforms will remain closed to such efforts, but I hope openness and some amount of interoperability is where the winds are blowing, at least outside of xitter. If Threads adds support for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23689570/activitypub-protocol-standard-social-network">ActivityPub</a> (the protocol that Mastodon uses), as Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/introducing-threads-new-app-text-sharing/">announced</a> it would, that would send a powerful signal to commercial social networks, despite Meta&rsquo;s record of locking people inside Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>Openness and interoperability ought to be goals we can agree on. Imagine if your email provider didn&rsquo;t let you communicate with people outside their service. Imagine them holding your contacts hostage if you changed services. What about not being able to choose how you read your email, that is, with which app or web interface? Avoiding that kind of nonsense is a major promise of Mastodon and the other kinds of software that use ActivityPub.</p>

			 <p>Driving north on Rt. 16, I can still be surprised by the appearance of the White Mountains from a few hilltops between Wakefield and Ossipee. For a moment, today, I was even treated to Mt. Chocorua and Mt. Washington as the dominant figures in a stunning pattern of silhouettes that rose into the late afternoon sky. Chocorua was front and center, and Washington rose up behind it in a pairing that is impossible to imagine in Chocorua&rsquo;s shadow, where I grew up, let alone in Mt. Washington Valley. where I am now.</p>

			 <p>In the past, I rarely watched YouTube, but the <a title="Bye Bye Birdie" href="https://markstoneman.com/2022/12/04/bye-bye-birdie/">bird site&rsquo;s corruption</a> has seen me on YouTube much more often, as I search for content about Ukraine. Recently I found a good Ukrainian-made series about how Ukrainians in various kinds of media have adapted to Russia&rsquo;s full-scale invasion. There are 10 episodes, not counting a 3-minute trailer. All but the last are about 15 minutes long, and the final one is 25 minutes. (I&rsquo;ve seen half of them so far.) The series is largely in Ukrainian with English subtitles, and partly in English with Ukrainian subtitles, depending on who is speaking. The titles on YouTube are in Ukrainian, but there&rsquo;s a playlist that has them all in the correct order. Besides, you don&rsquo;t need to know the Cyrillic alphabet to read the episode numbers (єпізод 1, 2, 3 …) of <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1PP_OaYvIQW7NZgkC-UKXBDAqaR5zeV6&si=Zv-maz1DI6_i1wo9">&ldquo;Media at War&rdquo; (Медіа на війні)</a> and to watch Ukrainians speak for themselves.</p>

			 <p>My last post was of snow and now August is almost over? Yikes!</p>
<p>After commuting thousands of miles between DC and New Hampshire since my <a href="%5Bmarkstoneman.com/2022/07/1...%5D(https://markstoneman.com/2022/07/15/to-everything-there-is-a-season/)" title="To Everything There Is a Season">father&rsquo;s passing</a>, I&rsquo;ve spent the summer in New Hampshire. The marathon driving sessions wear on me, so I&rsquo;ve been avoiding them.</p>
<p>The driving was because I haven&rsquo;t found a good way to have my mother live alone for more than a few weeks at a time. I haven&rsquo;t worked out a strategy for getting her help while preserving as much of her independence as possible. So I&rsquo;ve been the help.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s a good thing, even if it often feels like I’m treading water. During my father’s final months, everything had to be about him. Now I’m able to take the time to work out my mother’s specific needs, even as she works out the business of living as a widow after more than sixty-five years of marriage.</p>
<p>Besides, a health issue has come up that we have to deal with.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.todaystotalitarianism.com/under-cover-of-war">Under Cover of War: The Kremlin&rsquo;s Fascist Project</a>&quot; by Nancy Ries, <em>Today&rsquo;s Totalitarianism</em>, August 2022.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The war is a profound turning point, ending any pretense of “soft” authoritarianism with its modicum of space for resistance. The Kremlin’s fascist project may not succeed in the end, but it is crucial to see its effects within Russia as a fundamental component of the 2022 attack on Ukraine…. The Kremlin structures its war-making machine in ways that deliberately produce atrocity…. [And on TV, there is] a &ldquo;pedagogy&rdquo; of exterminist consciousness and practice, a key tool of the fascist project unfolding within and beyond Russia.</p>

"Christmas collection of the Bavarian Red Cross for our men in field gray" reads the caption of this Red Cross poster from Germany during the Great War. The angelic Christkind it features shines bright yellow in the dark Christmas night as she delivers parcels wrapped in field grey to men on the front. Stars twinkle above her, and there is snow underfoot. To her left is a sled heavy with more parcels, and to her right is a dependable, mustached soldier, pipe in mouth, a freshly delivered parcel in his hands.

			 <p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/ytOUuTaQOls">press conference</a> this afternoon reminds me of what a disaster we averted by showing the orange blob the door after one term. I get frustrated by the slow pace of our response to the invasion (and the horrible laissez-faire federal response to the pandemic nowadays), but oh how much worse this could have been. Meanwhile, I am grateful for the example Ukrainians are providing us, shining light through the cold winter darkness. <em>Slava Ukraini!</em> 🇺🇦</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s so hard to look away from Musk&rsquo;s wrecking ball when I go to Twitter for voices on Ukraine. Also hard not to comment on other people&rsquo;s posts. Now the would-be dictator of the bird site is banning and unbanning journalists, depending on his mood and random Twitter polls. He&rsquo;s also banning links to all kinds of outside networks, even Linktree. He might change his mind about some sites by playing the gracious leader who puts things to a plebiscite, but who needs that? More and more diehards are leaving. I&rsquo;d like to see regulators take an aggressive look at what he&rsquo;s doing. But I&rsquo;d also like to see media outlets, government offices, and other big institutions set up their own Mastodon servers to render the Big Twit&rsquo;s actions moot.</p>
<p>Evening update: Poof! Just like that, the latest stupid policies have vanished from the bird site&rsquo;s support pages, while Musk is conducting a poll about whether he should hire a different CEO in place of himself. Of course, none or all of these things could be true by morning.</p>

			 <p>The new owner of Twitter is behaving in a way that has forced me to make a decision. Can I, in good conscience, continue to produce content that earns ad revenue for a man who is now working to normalize transphobic, antisemitic, racist, misogynistic, fascistic speech and other kinds of dangerous hate and disinformation? I know how to survive and even thrive while blocking out the worst of these things, but do I want to be part of such an ecosystem? It's clear now that the chief twit knows what he is doing. He is gaslighting us with his "free speech" and "transparency" rhetoric, and I've had enough.</p>
<p>I am angry that Twitter is being ruined in such fashion, and I feel the poorer for its loss. Twitter is where I first learned about Trayvon Martin's murder—several days before the newspaper mentioned it. I only had access to this news because of the overlap between academic Twitter and Black Twitter among the people I was following. (This was before the site's algorithm began to shape people's timelines, a feature I resisted adopting.) Many years later, the place served as a lifeline during the multiple crises of 2020: covid, murderous police violence uncovered again, the seeming attempt of an unhinged president to bring martial law to DC, and then the conspiracy to overthrow the results of the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Twitter helped many of us to overcome the crippling effects of isolation in this never-ending pandemic because, at its best, it facilitated conversation. Along the way, it introduced me to disaster, public health, and disability scholars, including historians, and to disability Twitter more generally. Most recently, the platform has been extremely important for finding experts and reliable information about Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the West's response. As a result, I have grown all too aware that not only does the European history I know need decolonizing (one clear consequence of the Black Lives Matter movement) but the Imperial Russian and Soviet history I learned in graduate school does too.</p>
<p>Across all of these topics, I have benefited from contact with ordinary engaged citizens. Twitter was never just about expert discourses. In fact, sometimes the information I sought had to do with things in my own neighborhood, such as a power outage, snowstorm, or possible explanations for the appearance of emergency vehicles.</p>
<p>Saying goodbye to Twitter is possible because I've already been able to connect with historians, in particular, on Mastodon, although reaching beyond them will take longer. At the same time, there are plenty of important voices still on Twitter, not least those from Ukraine. That's why I'm keeping my scrubbed account there for reading only, not conversing.</p>
<p>I posted a few notes about <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2022/11/23/mastodon/">Mastodon</a> a little over a week ago. If anyone is interested in trying it out, there's a new instance run by historians called <a href="https://historians.social">historians.social</a>. It was started by professional historians, but they are explicitly welcoming all who are working in or otherwise engaged with history. By the way, starting on Mastodon is only as hard or easy as you make it. My advice is just to dive in and then learn the options and features by doing. Don't worry about finding the perfect instance either because it's easy to move. But do read the rules because moderation varies across instances.</p>

			 <p>The new owner of Twitter is turning that site into something of a dumpster fire, so I have set up an account on a Mastodon server as well. I&rsquo;m not sure where this will lead, but for scholarly communication, at least, it seems like a no-brainer, especially since so many have joined. At the same time, my fifteen-year Twitter habit will likely die hard because there are people and perspectives there that I can&rsquo;t get anywhere else, at least not yet.</p>
<p>My Mastodon account is <a href="https://zirk.us/@markstoneman">@markstoneman@zirk.us</a>.

			 <p>Fifteen years ago, I wrote a short post encouraging students to <a href="/2007/05/23/on-writing/">write for themselves</a> on a regular basis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing is hard work for almost everyone, no matter how talented or inspired. Writing is thinking. Good writers do not usually have finished ideas that they then type out. The process of writing and revision is an act of thinking and discovery. . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A couple days ago, a tweet by a disaster historian came across my timeline that summed things up perfectly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221206013048/https://twitter.com/USofDisaster/status/1573191443669454849"><img src="https://mrstoneman.micro.blog/uploads/2024/294debe207.jpg" alt="Scott Gabriel Knowles: &ldquo;How do people who don&rsquo;t write know what they think about anything?&rdquo; (Sept 23, 2022)"></a><br>
( Tweet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220117202301/https://twitter.com/WmGermano/status/1427032243374104584">archived</a> on the Wayback Machine.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That Scott Knowles expressed this thought on Twitter reminds me that tweeting can also be a form of writing as thinking. This felt particularly true to me back in the 140-character-limit days; however, even with 280 characters and easy threading, Twitter can foster regular reflection, concise expression, and ongoing rephrasing and revision. Moreover, it affords plenty of opportunities to practice these things in conversation with others. Maybe that is what keeps me coming back, especially whenever times feel more topsy-turvy and worrisome than usual.</p>

			 <p>Perhaps Putin&rsquo;s phrase &ldquo;special military operation&rdquo; should be seen as something more insidious than a euphemism for war. At the very least, it is consistent with Russia&rsquo;s genocidal aims and practices in Ukraine.</p>
<p>If we take the Clausewitzian metaphor of war as a duel somewhat literally, the Russian invasion of Ukraine becomes a struggle between two equals, two entities with the same dignity, the same right to exist. After all, duels have traditionally been fought between two parties capable of giving satisfaction for a perceived injury by one to the other&rsquo;s honor. An officer could duel another officer, but not a sergeant, a lowly conscript, or a civilian occupying a more modest social position.</p>
<p>By calling its invasion a &ldquo;special military operation,&rdquo; Russia denies Ukraine&rsquo;s worthiness and sovereignty. It casts Ukraine and Ukrainians as other, fundamentally inferior, or devoid of honor, so to speak. Rejecting Ukrainian statehood outright, the term “special military operation” facilitates what the talking heads in Russia discuss openly on state TV: genocide, the elimination of Ukrainian culture, ethnicity, and language.</p>
<p>At the same time, the term &ldquo;special military operation&rdquo; renders Ukrainian resistance illegitimate in Russian eyes. Thus, Russia brands the soldiers who defended Mariupol to the end &ldquo;terrorists.&rdquo; And its leaders become apoplectic when Ukraine dares to fire on targets inside Russia and Russian-occupied Crimea.</p>
<p>Given the logic of Russia’s rhetoric and violence, the problem with &ldquo;special military operation&rdquo; becomes one not only of euphemism hiding war from Russians. The euphemism also creates space for, even favors, genocidal rhetoric and policy.</p>

			 <p>It feels strange to be back home in DC after nine months away in rural New Hampshire. And I&rsquo;m driving back up next week for my father&rsquo;s memorial service—driving because flying sounds like a terrible option these days.</p>
<p>My father was able to live at home for most of these past months. Facilitating that was a two-person job, mine and my octogenarian mother&rsquo;s. During his last month, he went from hospital to rehab, which I thought might become long-term care, but his old body had other plans.</p>
<p>Fortunately I already knew his wishes, so all three of us were on the same page when it came time. He was at the hospital when we switched him over to hospice care, a small hospital in the White Mountains, and the staff was brilliant.</p>
<p>My son made it up the last week, as did my sisters and one brother-in-law. Even my brother, who I hadn&rsquo;t seen in thirty years, flew in. On one of the last days the old man could speak, a nurse told him he was lucky. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>So it goes.</p>
<p>Early last fall, during a drive down to a different hospital to pick up my father,  my wife called me. Our first grandchild was coming. And then another call: she was there.</p>

In part that’s because I watched it in Trump’s America during an especially difficult year, but something deeper is at play. The film’s ongoing relevance represents an ambiguous answer to its directors' main question: What were the children of a New Orleans neighborhood learning as they watched their parents during the conflicts surrounding school integration in November 1960?</p>

			 <p>I watched "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" (1939) last night. Despite the many differences to today's world and the oversimplification of the state political machine, the politics in the film strike me as relevant to our own time. Thing is, though, it would probably resonate with Americans regardless of ideological or party orientation. Anti-Trump people could take its anti-corruption and pro-democracy message to heart. Pro-Trump people could embrace how the Washington outsider triumphs, and credulous pro-Trumpers could go for the anti-corruption, pro-democracy stuff too. Finally, the rough-and-tumble quality of the political game would resonate across the political spectrum.</p>

<p>To stand in Mann’s study today, with editions of Goethe and Schiller on the shelves, is to feel pride in the country that took him in and shame for the country that drove him out—not two Americas but one. In this room, the erstwhile “Greatest Living Man of Letters” fell prey to the clammy fear of the hunted. Was the year 1933 about to repeat itself? Would he be detained, interrogated, even imprisoned? In 1952, Mann took a final walk through his house and made his exit. He died in Zurich, in 1955—no longer an émigré German but an American in exile.</p>

Here is a 15-panel satire by C.J. Grant, perhaps meant for working-class Britons. In it, British emigrants could get away from taxes, but expect frightening exotic animals, cannibals, isolation, poverty, and homesickness.

			 <p>As a historian who sometimes teaches about Europe in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, I have to give Trump credit for one thing: His constant upending of the broad political consensus that emerged after World War II and the Cold War means that basic historical terms are constantly making it into the news and national discourse as quasi new problems, new questions. As upsetting as these times are, as abhorrent as Trump is, it is hard to deny the value of Ron Elving’s reaction to the president’s recent statement about being a nationalist: “We are about to have a national conversation about the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/10/24/660042653/what-is-a-nationalist-in-the-age-of-trump" title="What is a Nationalist in the Age of Trump">word nationalist</a>. And Elving wants to offer nuances to the term’s meanings in past and present—well, as much as anyone can in some 1,100 words.</p>

<p>In my initial academic encounters with Germany in the late 1980s and early 1990s, one of the things that impressed me was the availability of <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9783423046336">handbooks</a> as well as specialized encyclopedias such as <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geschichtliche_Grundbegriffe">Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe</a>. The textbook series <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?ds=20&kn=Oldenbourg+Grundriss+der+Geschichte&sts=t">Oldenbourg Grundriss der Geschichte</a> was a new experience for me.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Each volume offered a concise, chronologically organized survey (with key terms in the margins for rapid orientation), followed by a substantial historiographical discussion and bibliography. At the time, I did not appreciate the massive effort behind such compilation and systematization efforts. I just found these tools were quite practical for orienting myself in a given historical subject. Why didn&rsquo;t we have such useful tools in the United States?</p>
<p>Nowadays, it seems pretty clear to me that the difference had to do with how academic projects are organized and funded, and how their merits are perceived when hiring decisions are made. Perhaps, too, there is something in the academic culture that sees particular value in such projects, although I have no idea how one would separate such possible cultural predilections from the institutional organization of scholarship generally and of the discipline of history more specifically.</p>
<p>I do know that my doctoral advisor&rsquo;s approach to reading lists for our comprehensive exams at Georgetown University in the mid-to-late 1990s was unusual in the history department there. Roger Chickering gave us a massive bibliography for research purposes along with a so-called canon (read: very long list) of the texts that he expected every PhD student to know or at least know about.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> For my reading in Soviet, Imperial Russian, modern French, and modern British history, I had to write up my own reading lists, sometimes with suggestions by the professor, never with the ambitious, perhaps Sisyphean intention of producing a canon.</p>
<p>Roger Chickering, of course, is both product and producer of the American academic landscape, and he has deep ties in the German one too. The above example, however, is not meant to suggest that his approach was in any way related to its proximity to German academic culture. Instead, I mention it in order to underline what I sense is an additional reason for the (to my mind) weaker handbook culture in the United States, at least among historians. Such systematization is hard and its desirability not clear.</p>
<p>The nice thing about this blog is that it does not require massive overhead, although it does seem to have some institutional support. Nor must an entire handbook be conceived and created before anyone can use the knowledge being gathered and produced for it. The blog simply grows over time (since 2011) and can respond to new concerns and concentrations with tweaks to its categories and tags.</p>
<p>I bring this up because I was struck by a recent post on the francophone blog <a href="http://germano-fil.hypotheses.org">Germano-Fil</a>, a Franco-German production. The post is entitled <a href="http://germano-fil.hypotheses.org/2370">“Recherche bibliographique en France et en Allemagne”</a> and contains a wonderfully useful list of resources, the kind I would like to have had when I was studying German history. This list would also fit in one of the more traditional handbooks, but it is on a blog and can be accessed easily via the site&rsquo;s category links, which act like a table of contents. Does such a detailed resource even exist in English for the study of German history? Hard to imagine.</p>
<p>There are other German websites that mirror the old handbook and encyclopedia culture more closely in that they are the products of specific research grants, and they begin with a structure, like a book, instead of waiting for a structure to emerge, as is possible on a blog. In its current iteration, <a href="http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org">German History in Documents and Images (GHDI)</a>, a German–North American project, is organized in chronologically bounded volumes, each edited by a different historian (or team of historians).</p>
<p>Another site, <a href="https://www.historicum.net/home/">Historicum.net</a>, is a cross between a reference work and a reference library for students of history. Such an undertaking, of course, requires substantial institutional support, at least that is the impression I get from the extensive content, not to mention the logos of the project&rsquo;s sponsors—the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Universität Köln, and the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.docupedia.de/">Docupedia-Zeitgeshichte</a> also recalls a multivolume handbook with a correspondingly large editorial team. Like on GHDI and Historicum.net, Docupedia&rsquo;s articles contain no tags or links to establish connections across entries. Instead, each piece reads like a traditional handbook article. In other words, the enterprise comports with the traditional research and writing practices of professional historians.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about blogs in terms of academic cultures for another reason as well. The above-mentioned blog has an <a href="http://www.issn.org/understanding-the-issn/what-is-an-issn/">ISSN</a>, an identifier for periodicals. My encounters with academic blogs in the past decade or so have not involved this kind of identifier. Yet a number of academic blogs in Germany, at least blogs with some sort of institutional support, not to mention all blogs on the <a href="http://hypotheses.org">Hypotheses</a> portal, are now using the ISSN. Why?</p>
<p>According to the international organization behind this numbering system, &ldquo;The ISSN role is to identify a publication,&rdquo; thereby preventing possible confusion with similarly named publications, for example. But this &ldquo;digital code is without any intrinsic meaning.&rdquo; The ISSN contains no &ldquo;information about the origin or contents of the publication,&rdquo; and, most importantly in the present context, &ldquo;it does not guarantee the quality or validity of the contents.&quot;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Nevertheless, on the blogs I have been encountering, this number appears to be about making the web publication look more serious or legitimate. In Germany at least, but maybe further afield, the ISSN can apparently make blogs accessible to library catalogs, as well as to an international open access directory called <a href="http://road.issn.org/">ROAD</a>; however, it is hard to escape the impression that for blogs, the ISSN is more about gaining recognition.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Academic culture might be a factor too.</p>
<p>Academic cultures with a long and deep history tend to influence the ways in which new media formats are used. Blogs, for example, offer the advantage of speed. One can put pixels to screen and share one’s thoughts almost instantly. Gatekeepers are practically nonexistent. Instead, it is up to bloggers to make clear who they are so that readers can judge for themselves the worthiness and reliability of the blog. In my view, these factors constitute advantages, but they can leave scholars uneasy, steeped as they are in a specific academic culture. Thus, some blogs take on the forms of more traditional academic publications.</p>
<p>See, for example, the impressive and seemingly well-funded <a href="http://verfassungsblog.de">Verfassungsblog: On Matters Constitutional</a>, whose posts often even include a <a href="https://www.doi.org">DOI</a>, a tool to ensure the long-term availability of a piece, even in the face of changing hyperlinks or dying websites.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Aside from longevity, this approach might have the merit of making it easier for scholars to include any substantial blog posts they write on their curricular vitae. On the other hand, DOIs would seem to entail a prohibitive amount of extra work for many of us, perhaps militating against the rapid communication of ideas and research results that a blog can make possible.</p>
<p>Many research blogs give me the impression that their authors understand blogging and peer-reviewed journal publications as complementary. The former allows faster publication as well as more provisional and personal writings, but it in no way precludes developing one’s blogged thoughts further toward a peer-reviewed article or book. Conversation can also occur more easily in the blog format, since a response to one blog post can be written and published in a matter of mere hours or days, if that long. The benefits of such speed and interaction would seem to outweigh any need to &ldquo;legitimize&rdquo; a blog by adding the trappings of a more conventional periodical.</p>
<p>None of these observations amount to a specific argument or program, but I thought they might be worth sharing in the context of a blog about knowledge. Self-reflexivity should be part of any scholarly undertaking. Moreover, some of our contributors might be new to or skeptical about blogging as a form of scholarly communication and knowledge production.</p>

			 <p>We tried something new in connection with a conference called <a href="https://historyofknowledge.hypotheses.org/lbtb/">Learning by the Book</a>. The conveners asked participants to submit a blog post to <em><a href="https://historyofknowledge.hypotheses.org">History of Knowledge</a></em> in lieu of precirculated papers. One of the conveners, my colleague Kerstin von der Krone, did most of the coordinating work, prescreening posts for length, permissions issues, and content. Then I edited them, trying to ensure they spoke to a multidisciplinary audience, not just specialists in their authors' respective fields.</p>
<p>Of thirty-seven potential posts, we managed to publish thirty-five on a rolling basis between May 2 and June 5. Four of these were crossposted on the <em><a href="https://recipes.hypotheses.org">Recipes Project</a></em> and edited by Jess Clark instead of me. One piece wasn't published because of an unresolved copyright issue and another because the author had trouble conceiving of a short blog post that spoke directly to the conference's concerns while giving the original research context a much more cursory treatment. These numbers tell a success story. An overwhelming number of scholars, from graduate students to senior scholars, were able—and willing—to convey their core ideas in only 1,000 to 2,000 words. And they did so to good effect.</p>
<p>Sometimes, scholars will read aloud what they precirculated to conference participants. I experienced only half the conference in person, but the papers I heard generally did not duplicate the blog posts. Some presenters made their blog contributions a foundation on which to build fuller versions of their posts, while others consciously used the blog format to present a specific aspect of their work, presenting other sides of the story in the conference room. A great example of the latter strategy was offered by <a href="https://history.princeton.edu/people/jennifer-m-rampling">Jennifer Rampling</a>, whose <a href="https://historyofknowledge.hypotheses.org/2018/05/24/how-to-sublime-mercury-reading-like-a-philosopher-in-medieval-europe/">blog post</a> focused on an alchemic experiment in the lab, but whose talk dove into the alchemy manuscripts and how they were read.</p>
<p>One participant also suggested that blogging before conferencing forced participants to prepare better because their ideas were being made public in advance. Moreover, the process of writing and revising can force one to become clearer about one's own positions.</p>
<p>The higher volume of activity on <em><a href="https://historyofknowledge.hypotheses.org">History of Knowledge</a></em> lead it to garner many times its normal number of readers, thereby expanding the reach of the conference, getting ideas to an audience many times its size. Conclusions synthesizing the results are missing, of course, but what a way to get a first draft! If all history is an act of interpretation, why not make earlier iterations of that work public for other scholars and for engaged members of the public?</p>
<p>Reader engagement (visible in visitor statistics and in reader engagement with our accompanying Twitter posts) and the discussions at the conference itself underlined that knowledge as an object of historical inquiry can open productive dialog across seemingly impermeable disciplinary and sub-disciplinary boundaries. (Researching what hashtags to use for which communities on Twitter helps too.)</p>

<p>I have had health insurance through my employer these past seven years, but I still depend on the Affordable Care Act. It has made the scope of coverage meaningful, especially by including so-called preexisting conditions. It has also relieved me of anxiety caused by not knowing if I would have health insurance from one year to the next. Yes, coverage has been growing more expensive, but at least there have been those statewide exchanges and—if need be—subsidies, which, I thought, would still make insurance possible.</p>

			 <p>The following quote from an article about art education seems to have broader implications:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Early excitement for the Internet’s democratic potential has been replaced by a complicated marketplace of competing agendas of consumption, entertainment, social networking, and political action that continues to offer both opportunity and exclusion. Increased participation is coupled with a persistent digital divide, a gap in who has access to digital technologies and who does not, illustrating that ‘disparities in technology access and use are related to socioeconomic status, with income, educational level and race among the factors associated with technological attainment‘ (Mehra, Merkel, &amp; Bishop, 2004, p. 782). Opportunities for participation have evolved through the advent of social media, mobile computing, and increased access to computing networks. These opportunities continue to be shrouded in inequitable distributions of access and expertise, functioning as a ‘new form of the hidden curriculum, shaping which youth will succeed and which will be left behind’ (Jenkins, Purushotma, Clinton, Weigel, &amp; Robison, 2006, p. 3).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, such concerns about access to and literacy in visual culture raise a question in a different debate: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access">open access</a>. How open are so-called open-access publications? Besides the question of digital access, who possesses the requisite know-how to locate such academic works, not to mention read, understand, and critically engage with them? Open access might be desirable, but we should not fool ourselves into thinking that academically sound, openly available scholarship will automatically be freely accessible to nonacademic readers.</p>

			 <p><img src="https://mrstoneman.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5144f7334b.jpg" alt="Detail from “Combat at the military station: Of Chateau d’ Eau, 24th February 1848 / combat au poste: Du Château d’ Eau, 24 Févr. 1848"></p>
<p class="callout"><small>I wrote this preliminary introduction for a thematic handbook article that was not to be (see <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2015/11/09/historiographical-impasse/">"Historiographical Impasse"</a>). Looking back at this 2015 draft, I think it contains enough ideas to make it worth sharing.</small></p>
<p>If military service had become a rite of passage for young men in much of Europe well before the mutual slaughter began in the summer of 1914, neither its ubiquity nor its meaning to those it embraced were foregone conclusions. To be sure, the fundamental challenge offered by the declaration of the levée en masse in revolutionary France in 1793 represented an important first step, as did monarchical Prussia’s turn in 1813 to the near-general conscription of those men considered young and fit enough to join the fight. Indeed, Prussia’s response to the Napoleonic challenge intertwined military service, citizenship, and manhood in the gendered construction of a nation at war that bore a striking resemblance to those ideals manifest in the mobilizations of 1914.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Nonetheless, near-universal manhood conscription took many more decades to predominate on the continent (never mind the United Kingdom, which did not resort to it until 1916).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, the path was not at all direct, not from the state’s and army’s side nor from the general population’s. For the state and its military leadership, big citizens’ armies could be desirable for fighting a foreign enemy, but they could also present a threat to the domestic-political status quo because they might not allow themselves to be used to suppress protest or insurrection at home. A further decisive factor was technology and how military leaders came to use it. Especially important were the railroads and the development of strategic thought and organizational structures that placed a premium on mobilizing large numbers of men at once for a decisive blow of the kind Helmuth von Moltke pulled off for Prussia at Königgrätz (aka Sadowa) in 1866 and at Sedan in 1870 during the wars that produced a German nation-state.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Of course, an approach to war of this kind also required large numbers of trained conscripts and experienced reservists. But first things first. The men targeted by conscription (and then the reserves) and the families and communities in which they had been raised first needed to learn to see the state’s call to the colors as legitimate and inescapable, let alone perceive value in the prospect.</p>
<p>Nineteenth-century discourses and attitudes regarding conscription were informed by normative assumptions about manhood in connection with a wide range of topics—civic or national duty and martial sacrifice, forbearance and manliness, masculinity and bravery, willpower and human flesh versus modern weaponry (especially later in the century), the impact of length of service on soldiers’ relationship to civilian society, civilian upbringings and soldiers’ political reliability, the reputational impact of military service on veterans returning to civilian life, and so on. The gendered matrix of military service and citizenship was integral to warfare and its sociopolitical effects in Europe. This matrix is the subject of the first of three thematic sections comprising this [unrealized] chapter. Ordinary men in uniform occupy the center of this analysis, but other men and women who joined or supported the armed struggles—interstate and intrastate—are also considered.</p>
<p>The importance and meaning of conscription in this period was also affected by the increasing cachet of nationality as an organizing principle for the European state system, or at least as a cultural manifestation that states could leverage.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Whether in the ranks as conscripts, as substitutes for conscripts, as wartime volunteers, or by vocation, soldiers were beginning to be identified—and even identify themselves, at least in wartime—with the nation-state or the national cause that they served. Many fought in conflicts that had national resonance among the general population, such as the Crimean War (1853–56), and many others fought in wars that led to the creation of the Italian and German nation-states (achieved in 1861 and 1871, respectively). The last case also entailed the national humiliation of France—widely felt in that country—in a series of disastrous defeats (1870–71).</p>
<p>These conflicts did not just involve soldiers in the service of the state, however. The rise of nationality and “the people” as relevant factors saw men (and even women) join irregular formations to attain their national goals or, in the case of Italy, at least redeem their nation’s honor, whether that meant overturning a foreign or particularistic ruler (especially during the European revolutions of 1848) or defending their nation against a foreign invader or dying in the attempt. Or so the nationalist narratives went, even if some probably took up arms to defend their home and locality against the privations of requisitioning and marauding.</p>
<p>These decades also saw men and women (and youth) in cities resort to violence in order to change constitutional structures or protest economic and social conditions.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Whether or not any military experience was involved in the barricade building of 1848, memories of earlier revolts had certainly been passed down to the frequently subaltern generations of that time, a legacy that was also evident during the Paris Commune’s struggle in 1871.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Intertwined with implicit and explicit discourses about citizenship and belonging—and thus about manhood and womanhood, too—these episodes also belonged to the complex, often violent process of nation formation and consolidation. At the same time, in this context of nation-making wars and insurrections, the seemingly contradictory phenomenon of international volunteers serving a national cause must also be considered.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>The circles of social actors and norms to potentially include in a gendered analysis of the above mentioned wars and insurrections could be expanded a great deal further, if space constraints and available research permitted it. Whenever gender played a role in constructing or understanding the motivation and practices of those fighting, that role conceptually comprised both masculinity and femininity because gender, like class and race, is a relational concept. If the military world had become almost exclusively male and masculine in the nineteenth century, that manhood still presupposed relationships with women and femininity.</p>
<p>Normative femininity might be embodied in the appearance and comportment of women accompanying the army (in France, holdovers like the cantinère) or nursing the wounded (in the Crimea, Mary Seacole and Florence Nightingale). There were also the women at home for whom one fought, or the girl one intended to marry after completing active duty. Normative images of women in the minds of soldiers could affect those soldiers’ reactions to encounters with women in wartime, in the course of requisitioning food from civilians or sleeping in civilians’ homes or outbuildings—or when fighting irregulars or taking a town street by street. Finally, a siege army could not make distinctions between soldiers and civilians, men and woman, adults and children in a besieged city (as in the Prussian-German siege of Paris in 1870–71). On the other hand, policy decisions reached in the besieged city itself (or policy lacunae) could create great differences—between rich and poor, soldiers and civilians (and therefore also between men and women), and so on.</p>
<p>No matter how powerful memories of the levée en masse continued to be in the middle decades of nineteenth century France, to take the most famous example of a nation in arms, patriotism and élan were not enough to win wars. One also needed professional expertise to train and lead men in war or in the suppression of an insurrection. With different educational levels and frequently a more elevated social background, officers might well embody masculinity differently than the men in their charge, especially if they were noblemen. Furthermore, as military technologies grew and military organizations became more complex, the knowledge required by at least some of the officers expanded. As the job changed, so too could the men doing it.</p>
<p>These developments were accompanied by public and internal debates about military leadership. What qualities did officers require? From which stock was recruitment most desirable? What training did they require? What was their relationship to their men supposed to look like? How did they treat their subordinates? And what about their relationship to acknowledged social equals and supposed inferiors—especially men—outside the military? How did their expertise and comportment figure into their practice of masculinity and its reception? What did military service and sacrifice mean to these men? How did social background and family history shape that meaning? Finally, what about their private lives? How did marriage and family fit into their military careers? To what extent did the bourgeois ideal of a separate domestic sphere obtain in this context? Of course, each of these questions could lead to more than one answer because officer corps were by no means homogeneous.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Furthermore, some important military leaders did not fit within this framework at all, most prominently Giuseppe Garibaldi, whose biography, relationship to his fighters, and influential public image form an instructive counterpoint.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, if soldiers were citizens acting on behalf of the nation, their actions might be expected to bear a closer relationship to the values and norms that guided their behavior in civilian life. Actual or alleged practices in wartime that appeared contrary to the predominant normative conception of war—still largely informed by the metaphor of a dual between two equal and honorable parties—exposed the perpetrator to charges of acting in an unmanly or unwomanly way and, by extension, his or her nation to charges of dishonorable, uncivilized behavior. Purported atrocities and other perceived wrongdoings also created opportunities for soldiers to exact revenge with drastic countermeasures that could contradict taboos on destroying property and even those on killing women.</p>
<p>Of course, such measures were never just about the attitudes of soldiers, but also the command climate, discipline, and policy goals. Furthermore, gendered contemporary reports and commentaries on the violence could be more about demonizing the enemy than about actual events or understanding what happened. The main examples explored in this section involve face-to-face encounters between German soldiers and French civilians in 1870–71 and the extreme use of violence by Thiers’s forces against the Commune in 1871.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
<p>All three sections [so was my plan] proceed from the fundamental premise that practices and experiences of manhood and womanhood are historically contingent, that men and women change over time, that normative masculinities and femininities change with them. The seemingly natural in their attitudes and behaviors is cultural and therefore a product of history. The second corollary premise is that war and warriors are creatures of their times, influenced by—and influencing—them. Contrary to many narrowly conceived histories, not to mention widespread ahistorical elements of popular culture, there is no universal soldier or military leader.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> Here, too, biology need not be destiny, whereas culture, if not properly analyzed in historical context, very well could be.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
<p>The third premise is that although the dual political and technological revolutions of the nineteenth century match up chronologically with the emergence of “total war” in the twentieth century, the journey never involved only a single plot line that led inexorably to 1914. Focusing on the role of gender—a fundamental component of human culture—can help to make other formative strands of the story visible. It then becomes possible to complicate Stig Förster’s powerful typology of warfare’s development in the modern era—cabinet war, people’s war, industrialized people’s war, and total war—whose emphasis on parallel developments in war and politics can resemble a teleology, one subverted by events after 1945 and hard to reconcile with developments in warfare in other eras and cultures.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p>

			 <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>"Global history preferred a scale that reflected its cosmopolitan self-yearnings. It also implicitly created what the sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild in <em>Strangers in Their Own Land</em> (2016) called ‘empathy walls’ between globe-trotting liberals and locally rooted provincials. Going global often meant losing contact with – to borrow another of her bons mots – ‘deep stories’ of resentment about loss of and threat to local attachments. The older patriotic narratives had tethered people to a sense of bounded unity. The new, cosmopolitan, global narratives crossed those boundaries. But they dissolved the heartlanders’ ties to a sense of place in the world. In a political climate dominated by railing against Leviathan government, big banks, mega-treaties with inscrutable acronyms such as TPP, and distant Eurocrats, the pretentious drive to replace deep stories of near-mourning with global stories of distant connection was bound to face its limits. In the scramble to make Others part of our stories, we inadvertently created a new swath of strangers at home....</p><p>I did my own part in the global pivot. For several years, I oversaw Princeton’s internationalisation drive, creating global knowledge supply chains. It never occurred to me, or to others, to ask: what would happen to those less sexy, diminutive, scales of civic engagement? We didn’t worry much. They were the remits of provincialism, quietly escorted from the stage upon which we were supposed to be educating the new homo globus.</p><cite><a href="https://aeon.co/essays/is-global-history-still-possible-or-has-it-had-its-moment">Jeremy Adelman, "What is Global History Now?," <em>Aeon</em>, March 2, 2017</a></cite></blockquote>

			 <p>I've been off RSS readers for a while, in part because of Google's exit from the game, but also because of information overload. Thinking about using it again and revisiting some old stomping grounds in the blogosphere, I found <a href="http://www.dancohen.org/2013/12/22/information-overload-past-and-present/">Dan Cohen's relevant comments</a> on Ann Blair's <em>Too Much to Know.</em> Seems I am in good company with my occasional ignoring of information—ignoring that I prefer to think won't lead to, might even prevent, ignorance.</p>
<p>I treat Twitter rather cavalierly too, as if it were a place to hang out, learn stuff, share things, and then leave—sometimes for longer spells. If I view all these information inputs in social terms, this is a perfectly rational way to engage with the Twittersphere. If I worried about missing some bit of news, some fascinating article or weird event, I would never get anything done and my mind would become a still murkier mess. Besides, meaningful ideas and conversations tend to have longer lifespans, and they make themselves felt in other contexts.</p>
<p>Dan's piece, indeed his whole blog, reminds me of another thing. Much ostensibly older writing on the web has value, and sometimes we should take a moment to read bits of it instead of gulping down and spewing forth a remixed version of the latest clever insight or rant. (I'm talking about myself here, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/09/24/bigly_or_big_league_what_exactly_is_donald_trump_saying.html">bigly, uh, big league</a>.)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The polarizing contemporary debate on science in the United States could be extraordinarily interesting for historians of <a href="https://historyofknowledge.hypotheses.org/about/">knowledge</a>, if it were occurring in the past. Still, if we could divert our attention from the news for a moment, we might find it offers some food for thought.</p>
<p>In the midst of the current conversation, which is experiencing renewed fervor under the new administration, the Twitterverse is exploding with talk of "truthiness," "alternative facts," "fact-based journalism," "fake news," and "lies." This rhetoric encompasses not just climate science but also everyday policy-making and "s/he said" – "s/he said" arguments. It is easy to get caught up in this conversation, whose ideological and epistemological battle lines seem so clearly drawn, but one thing gets lost—most of the time, anyway.</p>
<p>A pair of tweets offered a funny and useful reminder recently. Alice Dreger remarked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the science march happens, I plan to be with my fellow historians and sociologists of science in the "yes, but" crowd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Ben Gross replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WHAT DO WE WANT?<br>* ACCEPTANCE THAT SCIENCE IS A COMPLEX SOCIAL PROCESS!<br/>WHEN DO WE WANT IT?<br>* AFTER A WELL-RESEARCHED HISTORICAL DISCUSSION!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the concerns of historians studying science in particular and knowledge more generally do not lend themselves to sloganeering, they nonetheless have something constructive to offer. For starters, the above tweets remind us that scientists are social beings in specific institutional and disciplinary contexts. The embeddedness of science goes further, however, for science coexists with other modes of knowing.</p>
<p>Thus, if the scientific consensus about climate change is broadly correct, that does not mean we get to dismiss climate change deniers merely with rhetoric about "facts," which themselves have a history. Instead, what if we were to take seriously the knowledge not only of the climate scientists and their allies but also of their opponents?</p>
<p>This question does not represent a naive argument about everything being relative. The point, instead, is to recall that the producers and adherents of science and other forms of academic knowledge coexist in sociocultural matrices with other forms of knowledge.</p>
<p>Leaving aside religion, metaphysics, or issues raised by quantum physics and the nature of consciousness, most people—scientists and laypeople alike—take the existence of objective reality as a given, at least in their everyday lives. They are also willing to accept many scientific findings that they cannot verify with their own senses. For many of these same people, however, climate science is a bridge too far. Why?</p>
<p>It is easy to blame the U.S. education system or the scientific community for not communicating the scientific method adequately. It is also easy to portray science and religion as mutually incompatible. Such approaches do not take seriously the agency of climate change deniers (or immunization rejectors, GMO opponents, etc.) and so cannot engage their opponents in a meaningful fashion. Disagreement takes on an ideological air. There is only right and wrong, good-faith actors and bad—or the terribly ignorant.</p>
<p>Such struggles are almost inevitable and probably necessary. Nonetheless, wouldn't it be useful to explore the operations and logics of the alternative, non- or antiscientific knowledge that informs climate change deniers and skeptics of other scientifically supported practices? Put differently, the privileged position of scientific and other modes of academic knowing should not be allowed to blind us to other forms of knowing practiced by other social actors.</p>
<p>From this point of view, it seems to me, a knowledge perspective has much to offer, even if historians will have to leave current societal challenges surrounding knowledge to the sociologists and anthropologists.</p>

			 <p>Am still shaking my head over the new administration’s discriminatory ban on Muslims entering the United States. It was no surprise after the hateful rhetoric of the election season, but announcing it on Holocaust Remembrance Day? And not mentioning Jews in a statement about the Holocaust? I wish I could call these actions tone-deaf, but they feel more intentional and sinister than that, even if the more apt historical parallels are the U.S. rejection of Jews fleeing Nazism and the internment of Japanese-Americans as an entire class of people during the Second World War.</p>

<p>"I would suggest that a major source of our unease — beyond Trump’s personal unfitness for the presidency — is not that Trump is going to attempt to construct some fascist-style dictatorship, but rather that the trends that are manifested in his triumph represent a threat to our democracy that has arrived from an unexpected direction. That is what has left me, in any case, bewildered and unprepared."</p>
<p>"But Hitler was a fixated ideologue with a strong party organization, while Trump is an opportunistic narcissist driven above all by the need for adulation. Hitler was the 'little corporal,' the man of the people, who feigned austerity, while Trump is a billionaire who flaunts his wealth and luxurious life-style. Ultimately, Trump seems far more a hybrid of Berlusconi and Putin, potentially merging kleptocracy and autocracy, than the reincarnation of an ideologically driven, war-mongering, and genocidal dictator."</p>

<p><em>Prussian War Academy ca, 1900 via <a href="https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Berlin_Kriegsakademie_Fassade_Unter_den_Linden.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>
<p>I've been taking some time to think more about a slow-moving article on <a href="/2007/08/25/wilhelm-groener-1867-1939/">Wilhelm Groener</a> I've been working on. It has received a big boost recently from the GHI's new focus on the <a href="/2016/07/08/a-few-notes-on-the-history-of-knowledge/">history of knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>A truism holds that generals prepare to fight the last war, not the next one. Unable to peer into the future, they make do with the lessons of the past. Fair enough, perhaps, but this common-sense wisdom presupposes that military leaders will necessarily understand the salient features of the last war without preconceptions about war and officering affecting their discernment. In other words, the truism fails to account for the effects of prior training, experience, and acculturation in the production of knowledge about war. Instead, it implicitly assumes the existence of universal soldierdom, as if officering and soldiering—but for technology—were not culturally and historically contingent.</p>
<p>Wilhelm Groener (1867–1939) offers a case in point. A general staff officer in the German army who rose to prominence quickly in the First World War, Groener became an important spokesman in the interwar period for the so-called Schlieffen school, offering an interpretation of the war seemingly at odds with what actually happened. Instead of deriving new lessons from the stalemate, as his contemporary Erich Ludendorff did in a <a href="https://archive.org/details/Ludendorff-Erich-Der-totale-Krieg">nightmarish vision of politics serving war instead of vice versa</a>, Groener doubled down on the knowledge he had internalized in peacetime Wilhelmine Germany. Issuing from neither a military outsider nor an original thinker and steeped in antebellum military thoughtways and culture, Groener’s interpretation of the First World War can be analyzed in relation to his prewar training and wartime experiences to show the inner logic of the professional military knowledge and culture in which he was steeped.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My initial personal takeaway from tonight’s lecture on <a href="https://www.ghi-dc.org/events/event/date/toward-a-spatial-narrative-of-the-1935-harlem-riot-mapping-and-storytelling-after-the-geospatial-turn-20-10-2016">digital mapping</a>: It looks useful as an analytical tool, and for presentation, but in the end we still have to write narratives. Historians have to make choices, not present facts that merely speak for themselves.</p>
<p>During the question and answer period, the story-telling aspect of such enterprises became clearer. Apparently a kind of directed narrative is the idea. Unfortunately, that got lost in the presentation of tools aimed at the already initiated. An inordinate amount of space was given to talking about digital mapping per se and not enough about the history that he was mapping.</p>
<p>I would have liked to hear more about the insights that a given mapping project offers. If digital mapping were a product for sale, I would be the consumer who needs to be convinced why that category of product is desirable in the first place. The issues involved in getting value out of a specific iteration of that product are secondary.</p>
<p>I think many members of the profession are at this stage, which is one reason why gaining professional recognition (tenure) for output other than the monograph is an ongoing struggle. We need to gain a better understanding of the value of these projects.</p>
<p>But this public event was a keynote lecture for a <a href="https://www.ghi-dc.org/events/event/date/creating-spatial-historical-knowledge-new-approaches-opportunities-and-epistemological-implications-of-mapping-history-digitally-20-10-2016">conference</a>. Part of the audience included people who, like me, are interested in but not initiated in the assumptions and concerns of digital mapping projects. The other part of the audience, however, comprised conference participants deeply immersed in the tools discussed and the reasons behind their creation and use. Trying to bridge that gap is never an easy task for a speaker.</p>
<p>In any case, I look forward to the conference presentations tomorrow, optimistic that they will help me learn more about the historiographical motivations behind this kind of work. I just hope the history, not the tools used to do it, predominates in the discussions.</p>

			 <p>I was standing near the driver in my bus yesterday, waiting for the light to change so I could get off. When the light turned green, but the car in front of us didn’t move, the driver beeped his horn. I said, “People need to get off their phones,”&nbsp;which earned a laugh from the driver. Then he added something I hadn't recognized about the situation: “Uber drivers are the worst. I thought taxi drivers were bad . . .” I almost quipped something about how automation will soon take care of that, but then thought better of it. Will we lose our bus drivers too?</p>
<p>Today there was this&nbsp;piece on NPR, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/09/24/495186758/as-our-jobs-are-automated-some-say-well-need-a-guaranteed-basic-income">“As Automation Eliminates Jobs, Tech Entrepreneurs Join Basic Income Movement,”</a> which asks,</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>When we talk about the economy, we spend a lot of time talking about jobs—how to create more of them and how to replace the ones being lost. But what if we're entering an automated future where there won't be enough jobs for the people who need them?</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an interesting, if not entirely new question, but also something of a gut punch when I think of all the ordinary human interactions I have in a day. On the other hand, it's possible that the Silicon Valley crowd is informed by more than a little hubris and so can't imagine all the areas of life that cannot—or should not—be automated.</p>

			 <p>One of the new research focuses at the GHI since our director, Simone Lässig, began her tenure last October is the history of knowledge.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The study of knowledge in its societal context (as opposed to thought experiments about truth in the discipline of philosophy) has some tradition in sociology and anthropology, but it is still a relatively new focus in English-language historiography, at least in my experience.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>A good introduction for me was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0745669840/">Peter Burke, <em>What is the History of Knowledge</em> (polity, 2016)</a>. It says more about what the field can encompass than it does about historiographical debates or plausible narratives. Still, for an outsider like me, the book offers helpful vocabulary and categories with which to begin thinking about this subject. A different kind of text that I also found useful is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393337715/">Ian F. McNeely and Lisa Wolverton, <em>Reinventing Knowledge: From Alexandria to the Internet</em> (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2008)</a>. If the focus is on the West and elite knowledge, and if it offers generalizations that specialists might pick apart, it has the merit of offering a narrative that helps the reader to think about the production, preservation, transmission, and consumption of knowledge over a long span of time. I find such historical narratives absolutely necessary when first getting my feet wet in a subject.</p>
<p>Knowledge history can encompass faith traditions and the academic disciplines, of course, but it can go well beyond that to all walks of life, whether the knowledge is explicit or implicit, published or produced and transmitted in a workshop, and so on. With its interest in what people know and how they produce, use, and disseminate this knowledge, knowledge history does not feel all that strange from the perspective of social and cultural history. Indeed, knowledge history seems capable of dovetailing productively with these more familiar approaches.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0801472938/">Isabel Hull, <em>Absolute Destruction</em> (Cornell UP, 2006)</a>, for example, we learn that army officers in Imperial Germany shared a certain understanding and approach to war despite their diverse training, career paths, and experiences; however, we never learn how they came to share this common military culture. If we consider what these men <em>knew</em> about war, we still have a phenomenon whose cultural logic can be unpacked, but now we can also start asking about the education, training, and acculturation that helped transform young men into military professionals. In other words, we can begin to think about how and what officers learned and knew as well as how they produced and transmitted this knowledge. In this way, a static image of culture becomes dynamic, capable of changing over time.</p>
<p>The history of knowledge is not all that foreign to the business and consumption history I edited under the previous director either, even if that history has not been written with the history of knowledge in mind or in the vein of cultural history. The most interesting book of this type I encountered was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0230341063/">Hartmut Berghoff, Philip Scranton, and Uwe Spiekermann, eds., <em>The Rise of Marketing and Market Research</em> (Palgrave, 2012)</a>. The titles of its individual chapters might sound highly specialized, but together they show how different social and economic actors came to conceive and understand the markets in which they were operating in ways that modernday ideological adherence to capitalism as a natural, ahistorical phenomenon remains oblivious. The subtitle of the introduction includes the term “information” (not “knowledge”) but many of the examples in the book show entrepreneurs and others producing knowledge, that is, coming up with new ways to understand society and gather and use data to sell goods.</p>
<p>In hindsight, I think I found this particular book so interesting because of the knowledge aspect of the topic. For example, in “Making the Ledgers Talk: Customer Control and the Origins of Data Mining,” Josh Lauer shows how U.S. department stores in the early decades of the twentieth century had credit departments—not necessarily profitable—as a service to their customers. Yet some people in these departments came to understand how much sales data they were sitting on and began to use it to target specific kinds of customers with direct mail campaigns, based on their specific purchase histories. In other words, these credit departments took information already on hand and transformed it into new knowledge about their customers that could be used to increase sales.</p>

			 <p>I have had to withdraw from an interesting handbook project because of excessive overlap with two other chapters. My topic was on the matrix of gender, war, and nation in European wars in the 1850s through the 1870s. Given the limited historiography, I chose a thematic approach, but that produces the undesired overlap. What is needed instead, I&rsquo;m told, is a gendered history of these specific wars. Leaving aside the insufficient historiography, to say nothing of the challenges inherent in collaborations of this kind, where project requirements and individual research have to somehow come together and adapt to changing parameters, the impasse I&rsquo;ve reached seems to have deeper epistemological roots.</p>
<p>Making sense of the matrix of gender, nation, and war in the European conflicts of the mid-nineteenth century appears to involve contradictory historiographical impulses. On the one hand, the revolutions, insurrections, and wars of this era represented discrete political events in specific temporal, geographic, social, cultural, economic, and technological contexts. On the other hand, solidarities or identities represented by the nation emerged and achieved hegemonic status over much longer periods of time (even if war acted as a catalyst), to say nothing of the resilient normative and structural operations of gender in human societies.</p>
<p>If one scholar has successfully identified a discursive relationship among nationalism, military service, and the masculine construction of citizenship in Prussia during the Wars of Liberation against Napoleon, making the leap from those discourses to changes in gender norms (including the shifting meaning of military service in a man&rsquo;s life) and how gender operated in social hierarchies is another matter. Depending on the region of Europe, it could take many decades for such discourses to manifest themselves in ordinary people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>These contradictory historiographical impulses are also evident in gender history itself. If the field (earlier conceived as women&rsquo;s history) had initially promised to challenge and subvert conventional periodization schemes, the professional requirements of specialization in specific eras and regions has tended to reproduce those schemes instead.</p>
<p>If I have been unable to navigate these tensions and contradictions within the limited scope left open to me in the handbook project and given the limitations of the historiography itself, I nonetheless find myself wondering how they might be addressed within event-driven history more generally. Clearly one can explore the operations of gender in a specific war, but is it possible to draw conclusions about changes in gender norms and gender orders without taking a much longer view? I am skeptical.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One evening after work recently, I was half-starved and wanted something I could cook quickly. I saw some packaged gnocchi in the cupboard, made by De Cecco, which I thought would fit the bill, until I started reading the directions. Unfortunately, these were quite long, and they mentioned all kinds of ingredients not in the package, so I gave up. I didn’t want a detailed recipe. I just wanted to know how to cook the gnocchi. A few days later, while editing an English translation of a book about Italians and food in the modern era, I learned something that made me go back to the gnocchi.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In the early post–World War II decades, when the Italian food industry was trying to get consumers—in this context mainly women—to buy its new, ready-made food products, it decided that offering detailed preparation suggestions for the integration of other foods into its packaged products would improve the image of the new products, that is, make them more legitimate and appealing. But consumers bought ready-made foods for their convenience, not for the opportunity to prepare something elaborate. If one wanted to make something more involved, one could do it the old-fashioned way, from scratch, even if one might use certain intermediate manufactured goods like bouillon cubes or dry pasta.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>With this nugget about Italy’s food history in hand, I went back to the gnocchi package whose directions had thwarted me earlier. I still found only one very detailed paragraph, nothing short about the gnocchi themselves, as pasta packages in this country have led me to expect. But this time I decided I had better skip ahead in the directions, and, sure enough, what I needed was there, buried near the end: “In the meantime, cook the gnocchi in plenty of boiling salted water, remove them as they rise to the surface …” So that was what the “ready in 2 min.” label on the front of the package was referring to. Apparently this step is such common knowledge in Italy that there is no reason to highlight it in readily accessible instructions, even if the manufacturer still feels the need to make its product more attractive to potential customers with a detailed recipe.</p>
<p>But the package in my hand was for the American market, so why attach the same, apparently decades-old assumptions about food and gender in Italy to it? It hardly makes sense, except if explained in terms of the product’s postwar Italian history. Language from that context seems to have been translated into English without giving much thought to this context. Or is this a way to market something very ordinary, little potato dumplings, as something special? In any case, I’m pretty sure that the packaged gnocchi my European spouse bought for the pantry still carry part of their history in the accompanying directions, which at least I can read now.</p>

<hr>
<p>I recently noticed that the English translation of <em>Der Schlieffenplan: Analysen und Dokumente</em>, edited by Hans Ehlert, Michael Epkenhans, and Gerhard P. Groß, is now available from the University Press of Kentucky under the title <em><a href="http://www.kentuckypress.com/live/title_detail.php?titleid=3614#.VIEqeBN6r8u">The Schlieffen Plan: International Perspectives on the German Strategy for World War I</a></em>. Interestingly, Terence Zuber, who sparked much of the debate on German war planning prior to the Great War, declined to allow his chapter from the German original to be included in this English translation.<sup id="fnref-2178-9"><a href="#fn-2178-9">1</a></sup> It wasn't his best piece anyway, far more peevish than usual, and there is plenty of his work on the supposedly nonexistent Schlieffen Plan already available in English. Be that as it may, if Zuber's thesis about Schlieffen's war planning has been conclusively disproven, the assumptions underlying his work have received less attention.<sup id="fnref-2178-8"><a href="#fn-2178-8">2</a></sup> That matters because his work on Schlieffen continues to be widely read and discussed, having made a big splash when it first came out. Moreover, he continues to write and publish books on German military history.</p>
<p>Zuber makes his historiographical assumptions explicit on the "About" page of his website (<a href="http://terencezuber.com">terencezuber.com</a>) in a section called "Philosophy of writing military history." The text seems to be for the benefit of potential new customers, but that does not make it any less sincere or interesting. The first important factor he lists is "the careful analysis of primary source material," which he learned during his graduate studies in Würzburg, Germany. Zuber is talking about the venerable historiographical tradition of source criticism as taught to us in the nineteenth century by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_von_Ranke">Leopold von Ranke</a>. The historian, according to Ranke, is supposed to use primary sources in order to write about "how things really were" (<em>wie es eigentlich gewesen ist</em>).</p>
<p>Ranke's ideas presuppose that the historian can read and understand the sources in context and that their meaning is immutable. If the objectivity question is much more complicated than Ranke's phrase suggests, trying to understand "how things really were" still informs the professional historian's ethos.<sup id="fnref-2178-1"><a href="#fn-2178-1">3</a></sup> But how do we meet this standard on the basis of imperfect documentary testimony? How do we go about reading and interpreting sources whose meanings are frequently ambiguous?</p>
<p>"In military history," according to Zuber, getting at the past as it actually was "means above all the evaluation of training, doctrine, plans, intelligence estimates, orders, weather, terrain and tactical combat." I can live with that assertion for the moment, even if it <a title="'Terence Zuber's Image of War and the Schlieffen Plan Debate' [Stoneman's Corner]" href="http://markstoneman.com/2012/02/11/terence-zubers-image-of-war-and-the-schlieffen-plan-debate/">ignores important factors</a>, especially politics. But how can Zuber be so sure that he understands the sources whereas his historical predecessors and present-day detractors do not?</p>
<p>His answer is simple: "As a professional infantry officer, I am able to apply twenty years of military experience to this analysis including three years with a German panzer division. I work through military history as though it were an actual war plan or military operation." On the face of it, the assumption that his military background is historiographically relevant seems at least plausible insofar as the tools and techniques of warfare in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were not so far removed from Zuber's Cold War–era training in land warfare that they could not be understood from that point of view.<sup id="fnref-2178-10"><a href="#fn-2178-10">4</a></sup> Moreover, German operational thought—however vaguely defined and varyingly understood—enjoyed respect on both sides of the Atlantic long after the First World War.<sup id="fnref-2178-3"><a href="#fn-2178-3">5</a></sup> But is that enough? Does Zuber's military background really guarantee the accuracy of his analysis of military documents from an earlier era?</p>
<p>In his own words, Zuber "work[s] through military history as though it were an actual war plan or military operation." The key element here is Zuber himself. He is playing out World War One–era military scenarios on the basis of his own military-professional judgement, which he developed in the 1970s and 1980s. This statement certainly comports with an unfortunately common assumption in military history and in writing about war more generally, namely that soldiering is a timeless phenomenon, aside from the obvious changes in technology, organization, and (if the historian is really doing his or her job) politico-economic basis. But as John Lynn shows in his book <em>Battle</em>, there is no such thing as the "universal soldier." Soldiers and their institutions exist in specific historical contexts, and they change over time. These changes run deep, encompassing not only the externalities of the soldiers' and militaries' worlds, but also how soldiers and armies perceive the world around them.</p>
<p>Even if the <a href="http://markstoneman.com/2014/11/21/not-a-military-historian/">military historian</a> is concerned exclusively with the age-old question of how well armies fought, Lynn's argument applies: "the way militaries think is the most fundamental element of their effectiveness."<sup id="fnref-2178-5"><a href="#fn-2178-5">6</a></sup> We cannot understand what officers in the past were seeing and understanding, unless we first grasp how they thought. Indeed, Lynn demonstrates "the influence of conceptual culture on the reality of combat" for a variety of cultures and eras.<sup id="fnref-2178-6"><a href="#fn-2178-6">7</a></sup> The upshot of culture in general terms is that two hypothetical armies might be similarly equipped, but that in no way means they will understand the same set of circumstances similarly. The choices that the commanders of these armies perceive are shaped by culture, whether that is military culture in the broadest sense, specific aspects of military culture such as strategic culture and leadership culture, institution-specific cultures, or broader cultural "givens" that trancend the boundaries of the military.</p>
<p>Without accounting for culture, Zuber's efforts to "work through military history as though it were an actual war plan or military operation" run the risk of amounting to little more than a war game set in the past, but based on modern-day assumptions. That is how Schlieffen studied the ancient Battle of Cannae, but it is no way for the historian to work who aspires to understand "how things really were." Yes, there is a need for good, detail-oriented histories on war planning and military operations, but those histories must take into account the different historical contexts, including the professional culture in which operational decisions were made.</p>

			 <p>At the end of his English-language review of Anne Sudrow’s long book (in German) about the shoe in National Socialism, Neil Gregor has some choice remarks about German academic publishing, particularly dissertations and the second advanced dissertation (<em>Habilitation</em>) that would-be professors in Germany have to write.<sup id="fnref-2129-1"><a class="jetpack-footnote" href="#fn-2129-1">1</a></sup> Of course, he does not mean all or even most scholarly books in Germany, but as an editor and historian, I do have to deal with the tendency he describes rather a lot. I'm sure translators will feel Gregor's pain too.
<blockquote>
<p>Inevitably, there are sections in an 800-page book where the reader’s spirits flag, and where one wonders whether some editing down might not have improved the readability of the book at little cost to the comprehensiveness of its argument. No self-respecting German Ph.D. monograph would spare its reader a fifty-page discussion of the state of research, <em>Fragestellung</em>, and methodology; a suitably earnest discussion of the definition of a shoe is also, of course, a must. Yet life is short, and the half-hour I devoted to mastering the different kinds of shoe polish available to consumers in the 1920s is a half-hour of my life that I will not get back.</p>
<p>On the other hand, scholarly monographs, like shoes, have their own product history—they can no more be seen as isolated objects, standing outside of time and space, than the things with laces that we wear on our feet. In that sense, any such critical remarks are as much a comment on the academic <em>habitus</em> that consistently produces such books as it is on the book itself. The culture of subsidy which permeates German scholarly publishing, combined with a scholarly environment which places such emphasis on thoroughness, can all too easily permit indulgence. Rather like the German manufacturers this book describes—ambivalent about their customers, and irritated by their habits—one often feels that German academic authors ought to take their readers a bit less for granted. Who knows, they might then, like those shoe manufacturers this book brings to life so superbly, even produce objects that can compete without subsidy in the marketplace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind, Gregor begins the review by stating that Sudrow’s book “is one of the most interesting things I can remember reading,” and the bulk of his piece shows he means this. He is not criticizing Sudrow in the above comments, but rather particular weaknesses in an otherwise excellent academic system. I’m quoting him here because he made me laugh, recognizing, as I did, Gregor’s pain, but cognizant that the production of such pain is not a monopoly of German academia.</p>

			 <p>I study European history, so why did I post about <a href="/2014/11/29/sand-creek/">Sand Creek</a> earlier today? And why excerpt seemingly gratuitous violence? I have no expertise in U.S. history, but I am interested in the history of violence per se, which can reveal a lot about peoples and cultures at a given point in history. Further, the U.S. Civil War has some important structural similarities to the Franco-Prussian War, and perhaps to other European wars in the mid nineteenth century.<sup id="fnref-2081-1"><a href="#fn-2081-1">1</a></sup> Given the causal relationship between the U.S. Civil War and the expansion of violence against Native Americans out west, there might be a case, for example, to include France’s nineteenth-century colonial conflicts in such a comparison. However, my main interest relates to cultural taboos---or lack thereof---about specific kinds of violence against specific categories of people, assuming those people have not been perceived to violate any important taboos themselves.</p>
<p>In this particular case, the willingness to kill women and children indiscriminately underlines how little value these people’s lives had in the eyes of their butchers. Further, it suggests how utterly alien these Indians were in the eyes of their attackers, how far outside the attackers’ own ethnos or kin-culture community.<sup id="fnref-2081-2"><a href="#fn-2081-2">2</a></sup> Indeed, in Michael Fellman's account of the guerrilla conflict in Missouri during the Civil War, white fighting men broke more cultural taboos in their fight against Indians than they did when committing violence against free and enslaved black people.<sup id="fnref-2081-3"><a href="#fn-2081-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/resources/archives/four/sandcrk.htm">Congressional testimony</a> points to other attitudes towards the slaughtered Native Americans. We hear of white men with native partners and sons, for instance, although the latter were called “half breed.” The paternalistic congressmen investigating the atrocity were also humane, in a certain sense, but a question about how long the witness-cum-translator had lived with the Indians suggests how different that congressman perceived him to be. At the same time, commentators who sided with the Colorado troops responsible for the massacre portrayed their opponents as brave. Of course, it was safer to make the women and children seem like incidental casualties of a battle, but the self-respect of fighting men also requires a worthy opponent. Without one, the act of killing brings no honor and---we are learning in recent conflicts---can leave deep scars in the soldier who pulls the trigger.<sup id="fnref-2081-4"><a href="#fn-2081-4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Given the tiny source base behind this post, it only represents an approach to such violence, nothing more, especially since such an approach must also consider the specific historical context of this awful American story.</p>

<p>In terms of sheer horror, few events matched Sand Creek. Pregnant women were murdered and scalped, genitalia were paraded as trophies, and scores of wanton acts of violence characterize the accounts of the few Army officers who dared to report them. . . .</p>
<p>Sand Creek, Bear River and the Long Walk remain important parts of the Civil War and of American history. But in our popular narrative, the Civil War obscures such campaigns against American Indians. In fact, the war made such violence possible . . .</p>

			 <p>At a recent lecture on the Great War, Roger Chickering said, “I&rsquo;m not a military historian.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The phrase stuck in my mind because he said it two more times during the course of the lecture and discussion. I’m sure he was trying to avoid letting the discussion get sidetracked by narrower debates about military operations, which was fair enough in the context of his talk about a series of common structural elements in Germany’s, France’s, and Great Britain’s wars. Nonetheless, his words bothered me.</p>
<p>Of course, there was nothing surprising about the statement. And Chickering really can’t be called a “military historian” in the narrow sense of the term. Nor can I, his former student. But if stating that one is “not a military historian” makes sense in terms of the prejudices of too many academic historians, it also cedes the ground of professional competence to those historians who only focus on the battlefield.</p>
<p>As legitimate as narrower operational and tactical studies of warfare are, their authors cannot be allowed to enjoy a monopoly on the interpretation of the more military-technical aspects of warfare. The broad expertise and perspective of the historian who studies war’s manifestations away from the violence is also needed for the battlefield and everywhere else that people were killing or being killed for ostensibly political aims.</p>

			 <p>Although this blog would seem to indicate otherwise, I am still alive. Here's what I've been up to besides my usual not-blogging:</p>
<p><strong>Archive Seminar</strong></p>
<p>Someone else will be doing the GHI's archive seminar next year. Part of me wishes I was still doing it, because I enjoy working with the students, and I was looking forward to rethinking part of the program. At the same time, I need all the time I can get at the GHI for editing at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Editing</strong></p>
<p>I'm finishing up the editing for a translated monograph by Annelie Ramsbrock called <em>The Science of Beauty: Culture and Cosmetics in Modern Germany, 1750-1930</em>. It has been a challenge in terms of making the translation more accurate and readable, while at the same time working to keep my inner <a title="Calvin and Hobbes" href="http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/07/28/">control freak</a> in check.</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong></p>
<p>I have been revisiting my Groener project, but most of my reading is on gender and war in the middle decades of the nineteenth century in Europe as part of a handbook project. I'm enjoying this work, and I'm managing to do it because I'm not teaching this semester—probably not next semester either.</p>

			 <p>The main assignment for my graduate survey of modern Europe this summer was to write an essay that incorporated all of the assigned books and most of the assigned articles. I conceived of this assignment because of a similar one that I had had to do as a graduate student that I found especially productive, if difficult. (See <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2010/08/14/learning-to-synthesize.html">Learning to Synthesize History</a>.)</p>
<p>The essays my students wrote fulfilled or exceeded my expectations in some cases, but there were others that did not go as well as they could have. In part, this was due to the compressed nature of the summer term, but more than anything else, I think building a deliberate approach to teaching the process of synthesis into the course syllabus would have helped. Yes, these students were in an M.A. program and had taken many history courses in their lives, but few had ever had to do such an assignment.</p>
<p>Of course, we spoke about process both in class and in individual meetings, but the current senior research seminar I am teaching, which includes explicit work on process, suggests to me that I should formalize such efforts in graduate courses too, if I am going to require an unfamiliar writing task. That&rsquo;s not how I learned as a graduate student, but so what?</p>

<p>One of those questions came up in class tonight with a group of MA students discussing Peter Fritzsche’s <em>Life and Death in the Third Reich</em> (Cambridge, MA, 2008), a question where I grow perhaps too animated, maybe conveying impatience, even arrogance, or, if I’m lucky, simply passion. What was the difference between communism under Stalin and nazism under Hitler?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:html -->
<p>The differences are stark, but there’s that pesky word “socialism” and the collectivist rhetoric that is so easily conflated or confused with “collectivization,” never mind the existence of economic plans, mass murder, and a host of apparently shared phenomena commonly subsumed under the heading of “totalitarianism.” So why does this question sometimes cause me to push back instead of letting students gradually begin to understand, taking as many intermediary steps as they need to get there?</p>
<p>I would like to blame the heat and my tiredness after a forty-eight-hour power loss at home, and there’s something to that. But this is also one of those topics that can get my goat under better conditions, unless I am prepared for it. I am ready these days when teaching History 100 (“Western Civilization”), but the question took me by surprise in the context of a graduate survey of modern Europe. I am beginning to think it should not have.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s time to choose some primary sources for the students to analyze in at least a portion of our next class.</p>
<p>Something about this question can elude or confound even well-informed graduate students like those in my current class. Something is getting lost in translation from a past that grows more distant, more remote. The words “nazi” and “socialist” and “communist” are on many lips in these United States, but they’re employed in our own contemporary struggles over ideology, identity, and politics. They help us to create meaning in our own world, but this circumstance complicates the already difficult task of understanding the Germany and Soviet Union that existed in the 1930s and 1940s.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>While talking in class tonight about forthcoming papers, I heard from several students that many of their professors haven't cared which system they used, as long as it was clear and they could retrace the student's steps if necessary. That's also long been my implicit attitude, even though I ask students to follow Chicago or Turabian and I correct their papers accordingly. Lately, however, I have come to think that teaching a specific style is actually important, even if I have done little more than point students in the right directions for style guidelines, much as I was told to use a given style manual back in the day.</p>
<p>But why does it matter if they use Chicago or whatever else? The historian in me says that they should learn the trade as I learned it. On the other hand, I am dealing with MA students, few of whom plan to go the PhD route, so I should not necessarily treat such classes as mini-apprenticeships for future historians. If most are studying for other reasons, why does enforcing a specific style matter?</p>
<p>First, all educated people need to know how to use the scholarly apparatus (footnotes or endnotes, bibliography) of any text they read, because information crucial to the author's argument is there: evidence, intellectual debts to other scholars, and so on. I learned some of this by reading a great deal of history, but writing it helped me even more. And to do this work, I needed to follow a specific system that my professors understood, just like I had to write in English and follow a bunch of rules and customs associated with that. With that experience in mind, it seems to me that students can grow intellectually by acquiring more practice in such citation habits, even if they are not in my class as apprentice historians.</p>
<p>Second, my work as an editor has shown how far too many professionals ignore style sheets when they submit their written work for publication. For me, that merely creates a hassle and consumes time, but I can imagine much worse consequences in other writing contexts. Submit a job or grant application without following the directions? Forget it. Get an article through peer review that ignores the basic conventions of the discipline? Never. And so many other writing tasks—whether internal to a profession or organization or for the wider public—require one to follow specific guidelines and conventions. Indeed, it seems to me that we educated professionals should be able to learn and adapt to the specific style and formatting requirements of whatever writing task comes our way, even if that requires decoding seemingly arcane directions. From this point of view, too, mandating specific citation styles for graduate students can make sense.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are other good reasons, but it's past midnight. Maybe readers have some ideas, whether for or against?</p>

			 <p>I went to the annual meeting of the <a href="http://www.smh-hq.org/">Society of Military History</a> this year, because it was in the DC area, if way out in Crystal City. It was good to see and talk with people, especially a particular <a href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/academics/dept/history/people/profile.html?person=showalter_dennis_edwin">outside reader</a> of my dissertation, who I was glad to run into. The book display was also interesting, because I discovered titles that the same publishers had not shown at the <a href="http://historians.org/">AHA</a> meeting in January.</p>
<p>Less interesting were the panels, which are actually the main event of conferences. The problem was not the quality of scholarship but rather the fact that I have a low tolerance for being read to. I try to be patient and grown-up and stuff, but my mind starts to wander in this format. I wish that presenters would let go of the notion that they need to fill their 15 or 20 minutes with as much text as possible and instead just focus on pitching their main points and the central evidence that they are using to make them.</p>
<p>When I complained about this on Twitter and Facebook, I heard other scholars feeling the same way. We should not be reading our papers, but most of us do. One colleague on Facebook also shared a link to an interesting paper on <a class="no-file-icon" href="http://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/howtotalk.pdf">"How to Give an Academic Talk"</a> (by Paul N. Edwards). The trick, I think, is to adopt as much of the advice in this paper as one can without feeling so intimidated that one resorts to the crutch of reading to an audience. The result won't be perfect, but it will be far better for listeners than the standard alternative.</p>
<p>As boring as the reading format is, though, the panels in this conference were particularly well filled—standing room only in the couple I visited (one with senior historians and one with graduate students, both with papers read to the audience), which I have not seen at any AHA or <a href="http://www.thebhc.org/">BHC</a> conferences (where papers, unfortunately, are also read).</p>
<p>A few other impressions: the conference seemed to include both people who call themselves military historians and those who just happen to be doing a related topic. It also included members of the military itself, as well as professors who teach the military at the War College and related institutions. The mix reinforced my opinion that military history and business history share <a href="http://markstoneman.com/2012/01/31/military-history-and-business-history/">analogous positions</a> within the field of academic history and relative to the occupational fields that they study.</p>
<p>On the other hand, whereas we had the teachers of our future generals at the conference in Crystal City and the teachers of future CEOs at the conference in Philly, I saw practitioners (officers) in Crystal City but no practitioners (business leaders) in Philly. This might have been due to the proximity of the conference to the Pentagon and other military installations in the area, but I wonder if this one difference says anything about different attitudes towards history in the military and business. Few doubt the importance of history for cultivating critical thinking in our military officers, especially not the officers themselves, but I wonder how passionate about history business executives are. It would be interesting to find out.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a id="cite01"></a>Last week I read Jörg Muth, <em>Command Culture</em>.<a href="#note01"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong></a> The book’s main subject is about training U.S. officers for war, and it draws on the German officer corps in the interwar period for its useful comparisons. I can’t offer a review, because my own expertise lies more with the Imperial German officer corps. Nonetheless, the book deserves some comment.</p>
<p>This was both an enjoyable and a frustrating read, but the frustrating part had more to do with my own preferences. Muth (who I know and value) takes West Point in this period to task for some pretty lousy education (Fort Leavenworth, too) and awful hazing. I have no problem with such well-sourced assertions, but I can’t help but think there might have been a deeper cultural logic to these things that Muth does not seek to uncover, because it apparently did not relate to military effectiveness, which is his topic, not, for example, the deeper character of leadership, education, and masculinity in the United States more generally.</p>
<p>I don’t have the expertise to critique Muth’s interpretation of officer education in this period, and I’m convinced he knows what he is talking about. But my guard goes up when I read works that are not only critical, but also assume an air of being smarter than their human subjects. It seems to me that we historians need to be more modest than that. Still, this is a question of personal style, and Muth is by no means alone in following such an approach, especially in military history, which straddles a line between historiographical traditions, sometimes trying to understand the past on its own terms (as I was trained to do in a program and profession in which, unfortunately, “military history” can even be a dirty word), but also trying to judge what worked and didn’t work, a worthy question that interests Muth and many other military historians, to say nothing of policy makers, military professionals, and the lay public.<a href="#note02"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></a></p>
<p>Let me provide an example from the Imperial German period. In his conclusion Muth writes,</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The German Great General Staff saw a steady steep decline in performance after its founder and mentor, Moltke the Elder, retired. His successors tried in vain to emulate the habits and outward appearance of the great old man but failed miserably in their basic tasks—to provide leadership, strategic planning skills and sound advice for the head of state—until the whole organization collapsed in the apocalyptic defeat of a two-front war, which every sane staff officer would have thought to prevent with all its might (181-82).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I interpret the General Staff’s professionalism and competence differently,<a href="#note03"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></a> but Muth’s take is certainly consistent with a great deal of historiography. Indeed, his comment points to the need for me to participate in this debate with more scholarship of my own. The part that bothers me, though, is the last dependent clause in the above quote. Yes, the project that Germany’s leadership embarked on in 1914 seems insane from our own vantage point. It even seems insane based on our interpretation of what was known back then. But denying the rationality of German war planning and the professionalism of its planners amounts to a refusal to take them seriously and enter their thought world in order to truly understand what it was they thought they were doing in 1914.</p>
<p>But this is not the focus of the book. Instead, the Imperial period offers but a foil against which Muth measures German military professionalism in the interwar period, and he uses the latter as a foil for criticizing U.S. military education at the time. Furthermore, Muth is not so much interested in war planning, grand strategy, and so on, as he is in how officers led—or didn’t lead—on the battlefield. This is a crucial question, and his observations on the differences between American and German approaches to military leadership at the beginning of World War II offer plenty of food for thought, which I hope specialists of this period will soon discuss.</p>
<p>One last note: Muth provides the place of education and year of graduation with the first mention of each U.S. officer he names, for example, “General George Smith Patton, USMA 1909” (29). He offers this highly suggestive information to provide readers with a sense of the personal networks that officers developed in their formative years. This makes me wish for further, even prosopographical studies of the U.S. officer corps that employ such data, just as we need more of it in the German case, if with other reference points, such as the first regiment of a German officer, although I have also noticed some tantalizing overlap in the years that Wilhelm Groener and other officers attended the War Academy in Wilhelmine Germany.<a id="note01"></a></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As I try to write an article about Groener’s understanding of war, which led him to write about Schlieffen’s supposed <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/weltkrieg-und-seine-probleme-ruckschau-und-ausblick/">“recipe for victory,”</a>, I have to keep asking myself, so what? I don’t mean this is in a negative way. I haven’t tired of this topic. But I’m not always sure why it should matter to other people. </p>
<p>If I look at the <a href="http://markstoneman.com/2012/02/11/terence-zubers-image-of-war-and-the-schlieffen-plan-debate/">Schlieffen Plan debate</a> carried out mainly in the pages of <em>War in History</em>, it is clear that Groener’s perspective has something to offer that audience, because the man who initiated the debate, Zuber, accuses him of having "invented" the Schlieffen Plan. That is reason enough to bring up the issue, at least for those interested in the military planning that helped cause and shape what George F. Kennan once called <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/616.html">“the great seminal catastrophe”</a> of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>When I shift my perspective to understanding the German military’s role in the outbreak of World War One, I find the more nuanced perspective of German military thinking worthwhile for its own sake, but the basic story line of an inflexible plan that offered no diplomatic wiggle room and helped to ensure that Germany played the role of aggressor remains the same. So why should anyone but a specialist in military history care? Why should it matter to a general historian of modern German or European history?</p>
<p>The answer to this question seems to relate to our image of German history and World War I more generally. Do we blame that war on elites wedded to outdated notions about war? Do we turn them into alien “Others” who are impossible to understand in anything but stereotyped terms along the lines that we see for Britain in the wonderful comedy series, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/blackadder/episodes/four/"><em>Black Adder Goes Forth</em></a>?</p>
<p>Or do we open our eyes to a less comfortable thought? What if World War I was not an aberration, but rather part and parcel of European (and Western) modernity? And what if the officers who developed and later justified Germany’s war plans were not defenders of a premodern monarchical system nor simply protecting their own reputations after Germany’s defeat, but instead were modern military professionals whose attitudes and efforts might have relevance for our understanding of modern militaries far beyond 1914?</p>
<p>The latter point of view could make the question of Groener’s Schlieffen Plan relevant for modern militaries and, therefore, interesting for a readership like the <em>Journal of Strategic Studies</em> has. But does this story only have something to tell scholars of military history and strategic studies? What about historians of Imperial Germany? I think an answer could relate to the modernity of the officer corps, the Great General Staff, and the war itself. It might also help us to understand a story whose chronological boundaries transcend political regimes, insofar as this one reaches from Wilhelmine Germany until close to the end of the Weimar Republic, if not further.</p>
<p>As I think along these lines, however, I see a journal article grow into something too big for the format. I would like to keep thinking about why Groener's Schlieffen Plan might matter to general historians of Germany, but maybe I first need to concentrate on a narrower, more specialized audience. I have to write a lot more before I can know.</p>

			 <p>As I began writing a manuscript that I plan to submit to a specific journal, I thought it would make sense to follow that journal's style sheet, which is rather different from what I am used to. I noticed, however, that I was constantly looking things up, from the very first sentence. How do I cite that source with this particular system? How do I spell that word in British English? How do I handle quotation marks for this particular situation? It was hard to get any thinking and writing done under such circumstances.</p>
<p>I have decided to put an end to these unnecessary distractions by separating the formatting from the writing, making the formatting a separate step in my workflow. I will write in plain text documents without any formatting and using only basic parenthetic citations. I will focus on the content during all stages of the writing, editing, and rewriting. And then I will worry about the formatting. That will mean extra work in the end, but it will enable me to write without unnecessary distractions, which is what I need.</p>
<p>I handled many sections of the dissertation in a similar way, even when I was working with a style I understood, Chicago. In that case, I wrote five or ten pages at a time, and then I integrated it into the word processing document with formatting&mdash;after I was sure about what I was doing. This process also enabled me to devote those times when my mental energy was highest to just plain writing, and then I could turn to formatting when my brain was less sharp but still able to perform basic tasks.</p>
<p>One other advantage to the plain-text format: I will be able to edit or add text on the go with my iPad, whose text files I keep synced via Dropbox. Ideas often come to me on the bus, so this is no small thing.</p>

			 <p><a id="cite"></a>In a recent <em>German History</em> forum, Paul Lerner offers an interesting aside: "I used the medical Sonderweg as more or less a straw man in my 2003 book on German psychiatry, but I found that even as I refuted it, the need to explain the unique path of German medicine kept arising."<a href="#note"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong></a> These words speak to me, because I used Groener's biography to refute the rather untenable interpretation of a "feudalized" bourgeoisie in the Kaiserreich, even in the officer corps, but taking down that straw man hasn't offered a satisfying answer about the meaning of Groener's middle-class cultural orientations for our understanding of the Imperial German officer corps.</p>
<p>I also used Terence Zuber's interpretation of Schlieffen's doctrine and war planning as a foil against which to compare what Groener knew about war before 1914, as well as what he experienced in the opening acts of World War I. In this case, I was somewhat more successful in saying what actually happened and why, but far too much of the analysis and narrative was aimed at Zuber. That was still necessary in 2006, when I completed the thing, but now I am not so sure. At any rate, it can't be the only point of an article about war planning and conceptions of war in the Great General Staff.</p>
<p>Although it is relatively easy to demolish straw men, I can't stop there. I also need to offer more viable explanations in their place. I have a fair idea of how to do that in the case of Imperial German war-planning, but I'm less certain about the indirect relationship between class and professionalism that led me to challenge stereotypes of the Wilhelmine officer corps in the first place.<a id="note"></a></p>

<p>This evening I pulled out old handwritten sources from 1914 to reexamine some quotes, because I wanted to use them in a different way than I did in my dissertation. To my initial consternation, I found them hard to read. (That's what I get for letting so much time pass without reading that old handwriting.) Fortunately, there are so-called <em>Deutsche Fibel</em> around that children used to learn this handwriting back in the day. I've got a couple of these books that I used to teach myself well over a decade ago, so I pulled one of those out to review.</p>

<p>I've been working through more journals, putting interesting articles and reviews in my bibliography database and reading the things. It might be faster just to search databases for what I'm interested in, which I also have to do, of course, but browsing many issues of a journal offers a helpful overview of what's going on in the scholarship more broadly. I still have to pick and choose from the huge mass of offerings, but at least this way I see things that I likely never would have looked for otherwise.</p>

<p>Am I the only one who can get years behind on relevant readings? Silly me let teaching and editing get in the way of basic readings. But maybe I'm not the only one who gets behind. As much as I appreciate discussions about how digital scholarship could speed up the dissemination of research results, sometimes I'm quite glad these results come out slowly through journals, and that these journals are available online through the library for me to look at as time permits. I'm trying to get caught back up in a more systematic way, so that I can't use earning money as an excuse for missing new scholarship on certain topics. Still, we are talking about dead people who aren't going anywhere, right? And the pace of historical research is slow anyway. Besides, how often are the results of historical research advanced in real time? It's not like cable news channels and NPR are standing in line to review our output. Even blogging, tweeting, facebooking scholars have their own research projects to do, so that they can't pay attention to every new development of their colleagues at the moment it occurs.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://markstoneman.com/2012/02/11/terence-zubers-image-of-war-and-the-schlieffen-plan-debate/">Schlieffen Plan debate</a> has been dragging on for over a decade, so maybe I shouldn't feel too bad that I have only now read Gerhard Gross's excellent intervention (available in both <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Zeitalter-Weltkriege-Schlieffenplan-Analysen-Dokumente/dp/350675629X/">German</a> and <a href="http://wih.sagepub.com/content/15/4/389.short">English</a>), in which he explains the whereabouts and wherefores of Schlieffen sources better than anyone I have seen (at least for those deeply immersed in the problem), not to mention addresses Zuber on his own chosen operational turf—albeit with politics as well as incredibly thorough archival work and careful, nuanced analysis. Now I need to make time to explore the differences between his Schlieffen and the one I see Zuber's other historiographical opponents offering, especially regarding the question of "preventive war" in 1905. But that will have to wait. Right now, I'm more interested in Schlieffen's image of war, what he imparted to the General Staff, and how. And I'm interested in matching Groener's timeline against this, because what I'm really trying to get at is the evolution of Wilhelm Groener's Schlieffen Plan, that is, how he understood and wrote about Schlieffen over the years.</p>

<p>By the way, how does "Wilhelm Groener's Schlieffen Plan" sound for an article title? That's what I've decided I'll write first.</p>

			 <p>Uploading one's dissertation to the <a href="http://www.archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> is certainly not for everybody, because publishers will not want to publish something that one can get elsewhere for free. Nonetheless, I took this big step after initially just making it available on GoogleDocs and Dropbox, where I had the freedom to delete the file. After careful consideration, I have concluded that any articles or book I write will be substantially new pieces of scholarship, not just recycled, even when I draw heavily on my empirical findings and analysis.</p>
<p>(I have also uploaded my MA thesis. Two articles I wrote lean heavily on it, but they also integrate a substantial body of new scholarship and reach deeper conclusions, as they should have after the passing of so much time.)</p>
<p>So why not make my research available to the public? I have some unusual freedom in this regard, because I am not looking for a tenure-track teaching job, which means I do not have to fulfill those kinds of requirements. Instead I can continue to engage in scholarship next to my editing and part-time teaching. And I can submit that scholarship to the scrutiny of peer review, which I intend to do, but without worrying about finding time and resources to research and write a monograph.</p>
<p>Want to see my theses? Visit my <a href="http://markstoneman.com/research/">Scholarship</a> page, which will get you there. But keep in mind that there is a <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/288463.html">difference between a thesis and a book</a>.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When writing my dissertation, I was forced to confront Terence Zuber's claims that Wilhelm Groener and others had "invented" the Schlieffen Plan, and I wrote a section on the issue. <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/WilhelmGroenerOfficeringAndTheSchlieffenPlan">[See pp. 24–52.]</a> The debate has continued since that time, with new evidence and articles emerging, but I have not seen any significant reason to alter my basic conclusions. Thus, I feel the section I wrote still has value for anyone trying to understand this debate. I mention that here and make the dissertation <a href="https://archive.org/details/WilhelmGroenerOfficeringAndTheSchlieffenPlan">freely available</a> because some of the most important scholarship is locked behind the pay walls of professional history journals. That is fine for those of us with access to well-stocked university libraries, but not everyone is so fortunate. Zuber himself has been canny about this limitation of modern scholarship, which so often engages other scholars but does not reach out to the general public. He has rehearsed his arguments in an affordable book for the mass market called <em>The Real German War Plan</em> (The History Press, 2011). While this will not earn him points in academia, it serves the useful function of engaging the public, which more of us should do.</p>
<p>Zuber's ideas are important because he insists on taking Schlieffen's military thought seriously at a very practical level, instead of accepting that the German ideas of war we commonly hear about were almost insane, informed by marked hubris, or naive and foolish. Zuber looks at the military documents themselves and submits them to a reality test. How could this have worked? Why did Schlieffen write something with so many internal contradictions? Unfortunately, Zuber overreaches the power of his sources and gets things wrong. He also seems to conflate doctrine with strategy. Drawing on his own undoubtedly superb training and extensive experience as a U.S. infantry officer who reached major, he sees things from the perspective of a staff officer or possibly a commander on the battlefield. That is useful, but he forgets what such an officer cannot see, unless he has risen to the very highest levels.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this weakness today in a combative piece he published in German called "Der Mythos vom Schlieffenplan" [in <em>Der Schlieffenplan: Analysen und Dokumente,</em> ed. Hans Ehlert, Michael Epkenhans und Gerhard P. Gross (Paderborn, Ferdinand Schöningh, 2006), 45–78]. In the very last paragraph, he writes, <em>"Krieg und Kriegsvorbereitung sind eine durch und durch nüchterne, praktische Angelegenheit. Es geht um Doktrin, Ausbildung, Truppenstärke, Beurteilung der Feindlage, zur Verfügung stehende Zeit sowie Gelände und Wetter."</em> I hesitate to translate an American's thoughts back into English with quotation marks around them, but his basic point is that war is a fairly straightforward thing. Its core elements are doctrine, training, troop strength, assessment of the hostile forces as well as basic factors like time, terrain, and weather. That sounds like a perfect description of war conceived at the purely operational level, which is the only, albeit important level he examines. But what about strategy? What about politics and economics?</p>
<p>It might seem uncollegial to bring up Zuber's military background, since he is also a trained historian, but he has made a lot of his military profession, which he uses in ad hominem attacks on his history colleagues. In the same piece I just quoted, for example, he dismisses Annika Mombauer's important findings on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Helmuth-Origins-Studies-European-History/dp/0521019567/">Helmut von Moltke</a> the Younger with the remark that she does not understand the terminology and has no military background, whereas he served twenty years in the army. [See Ehlert et al., eds., pp. 45–46.]</p>
<p>There's a reason why U.S. officers (and other officials) attend the War College before they enter the highest ranks of service. They need to expand their vision to the strategic level, which will include politics, economics, and more. [See the War College's description of what kinds of leaders it trains: <a href="https://dde.carlisle.army.mil/LLL/DSC/readings/L2_chilcoat.pdf">"Master of the Strategic Art"</a>.] Zuber's own military background cannot have provided him with these insights, although his historical training should have. Indeed, I expect he has plenty of knowledge about such issues, but he refuses to engage the problem of German war planning at that level, instead insisting on the sole relevance of the factors quoted above.</p>
<p>That is unfortunate. To make any real progress in the Schlieffen Plan debate, we need to expand the scope of the discussion to include images of war, ours and those of our historical subjects. Without a firm grasp of such matters, we will talk past each other.</p>
<h3>Postscript, February 12, 2012</h3>
<p>A useful article on the Schlieffen Plan debate that I managed to miss when I was finishing my dissertation is Annika Mombauer, “Of War Plans and War Guilt: The Debate Surrounding the Schlieffen Plan,” <em>Journal of Strategic Studies</em> 28, no. 5 (2005): 857–85. She, too, points out Zuber’s apparent disdain for those without significant military experience.</p>
<p>Regarding the notion of making progess in the dabate, a great deal has been made, of course, and Annika Mombauer might be right to consider Zuber’s challenge over and done with as far as serious scholarship is concerned. (See her article in the <em>Journal of Strategic Studies</em> cited in my previous comment.) But we haven’t got to the point where a general consensus has been reached. And I suspect the great number of publications by Zuber will continue to sow confusion for a long time to come, as he insists on the primary value of his limited source base and his narrow conception of war. After all, academic historians do not have a monopoly on the interpretation and telling of history in the public sphere.</p>

			 <p>I am continuing to reread and ponder the dissertation. After getting over its many weaknesses, I see there is lots of good stuff in it, even if it is clearly in no way close to a book <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/288463.html">(following William Germano)</a>. There's also no easy way to extract articles from it. These will have to be conceived and written from scratch, although the dissertation contains plenty of useful building blocks for essays on Groener and the Schlieffen Plan debate, military culture and the General Staff, images of officering and professionalism, and so on. First, however, I have to consider the extent to which I should make general arguments based on Groener versus offer work that focuses more narrowly on him, albeit to foster further work for broader conclusions.</p>

			 <p>My research deals with war and society, while my editorial work addresses mainly consumption history. One might think these are two different worlds, but I&rsquo;m coming to doubt the validity of such assumptions. Indeed, the subfields of military and business history have a lot of similarities. Most obviously, they are both interested in organizations, knowledge, experts, and elites—among other things. They are also both informed by a tension between the historian&rsquo;s ethos to understand the past for its own sake and the practitioner&rsquo;s desire to learn lessons from that past for today. And they both have homes not only in history departments, but also institutions that train future generations of professionals, whether officers or MBAs. This tension also means that military history and business history are sometimes looked down on by the field of history more generally, even though bread-and-butter themes such as class, race, gender, citizenship, politics, and power more generally cannot be adequately understood without consideration of militaries and businesses.</p>

			 <p>I have just finished reading William Germano, <em>From Dissertation to Book</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005), which I can recommend to any scholar, not just those writing their first books. In my case, it offers food for thought about editing and writing in general. More importantly, it has helped encourage me to take up my research again, even if that probably won't lead to a book.</p>
<p>That has meant picking up the old dissertation—"Wilhelm Groener, Officering, and the Schlieffen Plan" (Georgetown University, 2006)—and rereading it with an eye to developing article ideas and a modest research agenda for the next couple years. Since I plan to reflect on this work here, let me begin by referring to some old blog posts originally published on <em>Clio and Me</em> that offer essential context:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://markstoneman.com/2007/08/25/wilhelm-groener-1867-1939/">"Wilhelm Groener (1867-1939)"</a> (August 25, 2007) introduces who I wrote about.</li><li><a href="http://markstoneman.com/2007/09/09/stumbling-upon-a-dissertation-topic/">"Stumbling Upon a Dissertation Topic"</a> (September 9, 2007) explains why I wrote about him.</li><li><a href="http://markstoneman.com/2007/07/21/paradoxes/">"Paradoxes"</a> (July 21, 2007) reflects on how I came to study war.</li></ul>
<p>Finally, my dissertation abstract and table of contents provide a useful starting point. And if you find you must read the whole dissertation, that is now available at the <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/WilhelmGroenerOfficeringAndTheSchlieffenPlan">Internet Archive</a>.</p>

			 <p>For a historian, I seem to have a rather cavalier attitude towards preserving my own past on the web. This site was once a personal blog in which I politicized, philosophized, and mused about the economic crisis that began hurting people some five years ago; about the presidential race that led to a wonderful, if cold inauguration day here in Washington, DC in 2008; and, less frequently, about aspects out of my everyday life, past and present. I've saved that stuff for my own records, but I don't know what purpose it serves on the web. I blog to make sense of things or tell stories or both, but I don't do so with the sensibilities of a diarist or archivist.</p>
<p>For the same reason, there are also a few thousand tweets missing from the early days of my <a href="http://twitter.com/mstoneman">twitter</a> account—though I understand that the Library of Congress might have preserved that junk. No matter. In the past I've deleted teaching blogs, a Mac blog, and a tumblelog that outlived their usefulness for me. Whether or not they got cached somewhere doesn't matter to me. I just didn't feel like maintaining them or having them show up in current search results. But I won't kill off a couple of my other blogs <u>Clio and Me</u> and <u>Language for You</u>, since they contain a few bits of useful information, and some of it even relates to what I'll be doing here.<sup id="fnref-1075-1"><a href="#fn-1075-1">1</a></sup> They're like the old notebooks that I want to keep around just in case, unlike the larger piles of stuff that went into the recycling bin. <del datetime="2013-10-29T20:01:11+00:00">I'll probably also keep <u>Commonplacing</u>, a tumblelog in which I have been collecting random quotes.</del></p>
<p>So what will I blog about here? For starters, I would like to dust off the old dissertation, which I defended in 2006, and ponder what I might do with that research. Occasionally writing about that work should help me clarify my own thinking. As an added bonus, maybe this blog will also help me communicate with others who might be interested in similar issues. Time will tell.</p>

<p class="captions">Park & Shop Shopping Center, Connecticut Ave. NW, Washington, DC, via <a href="http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/dc0605.photos.029394p/">Library of Congress</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday I asked how I could integrate the consumption history <a href="/2011/04/09/editing-and-consumption-history/">I&rsquo;m learning</a> into my teaching, and I pointed to a couple examples where it&rsquo;s already there. But I missed a glaringly obvious one: the Great War.</p>
<p>Consumption is a vital part of the story in Gerald Feldman&rsquo;s classic <em>Army, Industry, and Labor in Germany, 1914—1918</em> (1966), insofar as the purchasing power of labor was inextricably linked to Germany&rsquo;s social and political stability and, therefore, the country&rsquo;s ability to produce sufficient armaments to continue fighting. The point is more accessible in Roger Chickering, <em>Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914—1918</em> (1998 and 2004), which I have used in a course on the Great War and will use again next fall in one on modern Germany. There is also Belinda Davis, <em>Home Fires Burning: Food, Politics, and Everyday Life in World War I Berlin</em> (2000), which I will be using in a graduate course on war and society this summer.</p>
<p>I also usually bring up a much earlier aspect of consumption history when I address the Enlightenment and the public sphere: coffee houses. To make this point, there is a delightful reading from before the Enlightenment on the Internet Modern History Sourcebook: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1670coffee.html">The First English Coffee-Houses, c. 1670—1675</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, none of this is informed by a specific historiography of consumption history, but it does point out how this topic is already in my teaching. But there&rsquo;s a difference between including a topic and addressing it systematically. To think about war and society in Europe, I can at least draw on the periodizing nomenclature of &ldquo;cabinet war,&rdquo; &ldquo;people&rsquo;s war,&rdquo; and &ldquo;total war&rdquo; to help describe the level of societal involvement in interstate conflicts over the past few centuries (Stig Förster et al.). If such language and periodization exists for understanding consumption history, I have not yet learned it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the main point is to recognize modern consumer societies as having a history in the first place, instead of taking them as a direct reflection of human nature and, hence, rendering them ahistorical, as too often happens in simplistic political rhetoric that opposes capitalism and communism—rhetoric that invariably finds its way into student spoken and written comments. I sometimes try to do this with economic thought in the early modern period, but historicizing capitalism should be a central historiographical problem for the modern era, too.</p>

			 <p>Since I began my editing job a little over a year ago, I have begun learning a little about a lot of history that I had previously never experienced. While my editing has included a variety of smaller projects as diverse as the interests of the institute's fellows and recent alumni, my main area of responsibility is editing a new series on consumption history. Two volumes are under contract, and a third will be very soon, but I've been forcing myself to sit on my hands and not go into details here until things are actually published.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I have begun to wonder how I might integrate what I'm learning about modern consumer societies into my teaching. Connections sometimes come up spontaneously in class, but maybe I could do something more meaningful. Well, in the past I have used Emile Zola's <em>Au Bonheur des Dames</em> (aka <em>The Ladies' Paradise</em>), which I first encountered as a teaching assistant for Sandra Horvath-Peterson. And next fall I will use Uta Poiger's <em>Jazz, Rock, and Rebels: Cold War Politics and American Culture in a Divided Germany</em> in a survey of modern Germany. But how could I approach the issue more systematically (when I am able to make some time for reflection)</p>

			 <p>When confronted with history too narrowly conceived or framed, I often think back to one graduate course I took, "Issues in British Literature," which challenged me on a number of levels. To start with, the British historiography we learned seemed to have nothing in common with what I had encountered for German, French, and Russian history. Of course, different countries and different histories were involved, but not even the language or categories of analysis employed in the British historiography were as familiar as I expected them to be. This circumstance did not stop the authors from writing history and arguing with each other as if the assumptions that informed their language were self-explanatory. Their writings offered an odd mixture of history as common sense that rejected social theory combined with the expectation that readers should not dare question how they framed and wrote about history, because, well, readers with enough uncommon intelligence and specialized training would understand. The rest should not bother trying.</p>
<p>(It would help if I offered some examples here, but that would require research, not just memory and experience. Since this blog represents a mere first draft of some thoughts, and perhaps the basis of some conversations, I will just press on.)</p>
<p>For me, this situation was about much more than trying to find my footing in a new historiographical space. I wanted to take the material and integrate it into a kind of European history. How else was I to make sense of the modern German, French, British, and Russian history in which I would later take my comprehensive exams? But I don't think I ever learned to put these histories and historiographies together while taking courses and preparing for exams. Not until confronted with the challenge of teaching survey courses did I begin to accomplish the task of putting together histories, but still not historiographies. Some twelve years after taking those exams, it is still an ongoing challenge.</p>
<p>Whenever I contributed to class discussion in the British history course, I tried to relate what I was reading to how I understood German history. Since the class was big, everything I said had to be squeezed into short soundbites, whenever I got a chance to speak. There was not enough time for substantial dialogue, just for proving one had done the reading and was thinking about it. The sum of all our contributions was frequently disjointed. Indeed, integrating ideas from my own historiographical experience was a hazardous undertaking, because others&mdash;including the professor&mdash;did not share the same historiographical backgrounds and therefore could not necessarily understand my own language and assumptions. Unfortunately, I did not realize at the time how far many of us had already embarked on a journey of national specialization that made it difficult to talk across national historiographies with each other. It took my comprehensive exams to make that point painfully clear.</p>
<p>Thoughts like these come up when I am confronted with historiography that insists on its right to talk in a code that only other specialists will understand. I have seen a lot of rhetoric about the desirability of comparative, transnational, and global history, but often the same scholars use language that narrows their audience to a size too small to spark the kind of discourses necessary to analyze and narrate history across the national and disciplinary boundaries to which our training and research too often confine us.</p>
<p>The course in British history did not just introduce me to the shortcomings of history and historiography, which until then had appeared more coherent to me than they really were. While frustrating my efforts to talk across national boundaries, it challenged me to integrate a variety of approaches and questions within the narrower, but still rich field of British history itself. Our writing assignment for the semester was to write a paper that drew on every book and article we had read for the class, including cultural history, political history, social history, economic history, and foreign policy from the early eighteenth through the mid-twentieth century. We could write about anything we wanted, but we had to think of some sort of narrative that could draw on incredibly disparate material.</p>
<p>I decided that Britain's history was unusual in comparison to the rest of Europe's, because, despite all its eighteenth-century riots, it was the only state I knew that escaped revolution in modern times. There was my topic: social stability. And it worked. Whereas my discussion contributions convinced the professor that I knew little, the paper succeeded&mdash;not as history for other historians, but as an exercise in synthesis, which historians need to be able to do, but which we too rarely do, since acquiring historical expertise seems to require extreme specialization. That course taught me that I could integrate seemingly disparate historiography after all, albeit not on the fly in that kind of classroom context. It also taught me that such synthesis is not only desirable, but possible, even in unlikely situations. That goes not only for teaching, but also when trying to communicate specialized knowledge to colleagues with expertise in other areas.</p>

			 <p>History is one of those subjects that politicians and the general public are never going to leave to historians alone. I’ve got no problem with that, if those doing it follow basic rules of evidence and have a decent sense of what historical thinking is. I wish those proclaiming what they take to be the truth of history were more interested in discovering that truth than reshaping history to illustrate their own political beliefs. Such a phenomenon is not new, but the current trend among some conservatives to rewrite American history to fit their image of America today is irksome at best, downright troubling at worst, especially if such “history” enters the classroom.</p>
<p>For a taste of this phenomenon, read Steven Thomma, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110703075955/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/04/01/91478/some-conservatives-rewrite-history.html">&ldquo;Not satisfied with U.S. history, some conservatives are rewriting it&rdquo;</a> (McClatchy Newspapers). You might want to view the video on that page too. It would be interesting to find a longer piece in a venue that permitted footnotes to lead to further reading, but I suspect most academic historians do not take these rewritings of history seriously enough to address them. Such battles over history will be fought in the media instead, the standard of truth frequently being ideological purity. Let the buyer beware.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In "<a href="http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/121490">History without Reading</a>," Jim Cullen talks about a dirty little truth: a lot of students in our courses do not read, but we teach the courses as if they had done the reading, thereby only making things worse, because the students are getting nothing out of their classroom time. He suggests that it should be possible to teach history and historical thinking in such a way that we do not assume that the reading has been done. One reason students do not read, he says, is that we teach history assuming that it is obvious why one would want to study history, instead of trying to sell the relevance of history to students in the first place. Indeed, "so much of history education, from middle school through college, is a matter of going through the motions." Cullen suggests that we not accept that and instead asks, "What would it actually mean to teach a course that presumed ignorance or indifference rather than one of preparation and engagement?"</p>
<p>Much of my teaching makes just this assumption, because the Western Civilization survey that I regularly teach is a general education requirement at George Mason University. People have to take it, whether they want to or not. I usually ask myself how I can teach a given class in a way that lets everyone get something out of it, no matter how well prepared they are. Of course, a well-done presentation can convey information to everyone, if they are engaged in it, but working with source material, visual or short texts, is often more helpful. Still, if the assumption that students read too little, if at all, frequently guides my preparation for individual classes, I refuse to accept it as a premise for a whole course. In the end, I want students to read, because it is impossible to do everything in class, and much of history is about reading and critical thinking. I want students to read and connect this reading to what goes on in class, and I want to hold students accountable for that reading.</p>
<p>Hence, last semester I began doing regular "surprise" reading quizzes. I usually posed the questions in a way that allowed students to answer in five minutes in a paragraph or with bullet points. Some questions would work if students had just done an internet search on the subject, but rising above a very low grade required actual reading. In the end, the carrot and stick that is the reading quiz seemed to work; however, it also increased the grading workload considerably, which is why I plan to vary formats in the coming semester. (See <a href="http://markstoneman.com/2010/01/07/plagiarism-again/">Plagiarism Again</a>.)</p>
<p>Of course, doing things this way feeds into a system of rewards and punishments that still does not get across to students the value of studying history. I still need to convey why we are doing the work and even encourage them to want to do it. But relying on these factors alone does not seem to be enough, not even for the most engaged students in an elective history course.</p>
<p>Last week I listened to Daniel Pink talk about <a href="http://thekojonnamdishow.org/shows/2010-01-05/rethinking-carrots-sticks-science-motivation">rethinking traditional carrots and sticks in the workplace</a>. Pink argued that our minds and hearts do not always follow such logic, and employers could get more out of us with more nuanced approaches. His ideas found their limit, however, when a philosophy professor called in. Pink thought the professor was right to use the carrot-and-stick approach there, because it would work. On the other hand, the fact that the caller felt the need to ask indicated a certain level of dissatisfaction with her own approach, as I feel with mine. Pink himself added the caveat that students who learned only to react to incentives and sanctions would be ill-prepared for many workplaces that required more autonomy and initiative.</p>
<p>This last concern worries me, but maybe it is okay to ignore it in my large survey courses. After all, undergraduate education includes more independent work too, once students advance and specialize. Moreover, just getting to class and fulfilling the requirements of the General Education courses can help to train students in other ways, both intellectually and in terms of life habits such as self-discipline and task management.</p>

			 <p>I have been pretty happy lately with my [[thematic]] approach to George Mason University's required History 100 (Western Civilization); however, chronological confusion in many exams last semester made me long to try a textbook again. I might live to regret the attempt, since the course is only one semester long, but I have decided to try the abridged version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Civilization-West-Penguin-Academic-Combined/dp/0205664733/">Mark Kishlansky et. al., <em>Civilization in the West</em> (Penguin Academics)</a>. Trying to squeeze everything into the syllabus was much harder this way, even after skipping the first 200 pages of the text, but I am hoping the textbook will assist me in conveying a better sense of the chronological terrain. I have never been against textbooks in principal. I just have not found them to be practical for a one-semester course of this kind. Will this book fit the bill? Ideally, of course, someone would write a shorter book specifically for this kind of class. Abridged histories are usually still too long. Nonetheless, I am hoping that this halfway affordable text will prove to be an exception.</p>
<p>There are two other reasons I am changing things. First, doing so might help to minimize chances of plagiarism, since there will not be a similar set of assignments already in circulation on campus. Second, change keeps my teaching fresh.</p>

			 <p>I had no plagiarism cases this fall. Maybe it is because I had an unusually ethical group of students, but it probably also had something to do with analysis they did based on short documents instead of books commonly discussed on the internet. With few exceptions, there were no answers to be found on the internet, though I took some chances with the inclusion of <em>A Doll&rsquo;s House</em> in some questions. Even then, I did not let students focus on Ibsen&rsquo;s play, but instead forced them to relate it to short documents that I made available on Blackboard. I have made similar attempts in the past, but usually by asking big synthetic questions based on two or three books instead of narrower interpretive questions based mainly on two or three specific documents.</p>
<p>Another variable was length. These source analysis exercises were only two pages, if that, which might have been short enough to prevent the kind of panic that leads to some plagiarism cases. Of course, two pages is less than ideal, but I had more than 150 students this past fall. Even with a grader to help me 10 hours per week, there was an enormous amount of assessment to do, especially since there were three of these exercises.</p>
<p>On a related note, in the coming semester I am going over to the dark side with some quizzes and parts of my exams. By that I mean I will be integrating some multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank elements. As much as I prefer to have students actively produce knowledge in exams, there is a limit to how much grading I can and should do, a limit I far exceeded last semester. Moreover, I will still be having them do analysis. Unfortunately, multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions can raise the specter of copying in overcrowded classrooms. It is with this issue in mind that I plan to use multiple versions of quizzes and exams. I am just not sure if I will have to create these by hand or if there is an easy and free technological solution.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p class="intro">Earlier this month I did a post on my Hist 100 blog that might be of some interest to readers here, "Contemporary Politics and History." My audience was primarily freshmen in their first semester at university, most of them too young to have voted in the last election.</p>
<p>I have said this in class, but it needs repeating here: Our contemporary American political discourse about socialism and nazism has absolutely nothing to do with those terms and phenomena in actual history. While we are not in class to talk about American politics, I want to point out how language and history are being abused for political purposes. I am not doing this to undermine the stances of politicians who use hyperbole to make their points. There are perfectly good ideological and policy reasons that one can bring to either side of the health care debate, the energy policy debate, environmental policy debates, and so on. But none of these reasons has anything to do with Hitler, nazism, communism, or socialism&mdash;not if we are being honest, and as long as we are willing to see the slippery slope argument for what it is, a logical fallacy.</p>
<p>This abuse of history used to just offend me as a citizen who knew something about history, but addressing the abuse became part of my teaching job this summer when I had a student try to explain Hitler in terms of "socialism" and "big government." That is when I realized that not only was history being abused for political purposes, but our contemporary political discourse was getting in the way of students understanding the past. That's why I wrote a blog post on my own history blog sarcastically entitled, "<a href="http://markstoneman.com/2009/08/28/what-having-a-socialist-nazi-in-the-white-house-means-for-the-classroom/">What Having a Socialist Nazi in the White House Means for the Classroom</a>."</p>
<p>I could follow the logic of the student who described Hitler in terms of "socialism" and "big government," if I were willing to understand the past in terms of this country's contemporary self-image, but I am not. We need to take the past on its own terms and try to understand it in some detail before we attempt easy analogies. In other words, my concern relates to historical thinking, that is, that thing I began teaching you with the reading assignments from August 31st, including <a href="https://www.geraldschlabach.net/resources/courses/handouts/sense-of-history/">Gerald Schlabach's "A Sense of History."</a></p>

			 <p>I am probably not alone when I say that I have a hard time taking GOP “socialism” rhetoric seriously. The same goes for right-wing attempts to equate Obama with Hitler. Apparently, however, I need to keep this rhetoric in mind when planning my classes for it has entered my classroom in an unexpected way. In a blue book essay about totalitarianism this summer, one student explained nazism in terms of “socialism” and “big government.” There was no political intent behind these statements. The student simply drew on the language of everyday life, as students are wont to do.</p>
<p>This is a sad commentary on what rhetorical excess on the right is doing to our everyday vocabulary, but it also presents an opportunity. Without engaging in politicking, I can use this apparent linguistic and cultural deficit not only as motivation to be more thorough about how I teach socialism, nazism, and other modern political ideologies and systems, but also as an example for historical thinking. My instinct here is to talk about the use and abuse of history, which is probably what I will do. On the other hand, however, some of those who throw around the “s” word really believe that socialism is on the march in the United States. If I were to take such fears seriously, I would also use them to teach my students about how the meaning of language shifts and even mutates over time, sometimes meaning different things to different groups of people. This too would be a worthwhile lesson, although it would bring me closer to something that some students might perceive as politicking. I should probably take that chance.</p>

			 <p>The battle over health care reform has got me down. Like last year during the presidential campaign, one has to deal with two discursive opponents. On one hand, there are huge packs of lies being spread. On the other hand, there is the actual question of the government’s role in health care. If only we could concentrate on just this second thing and the actual proposals being discussed.</p>
<p>Instead of this being a relatively normal legislative process, all the so-called town hall meetings have turned this into an extension of last year’s campaign. It just doesn’t end. I suppose if I actually had a representative, I would get more involved in the process, but DC citizens have no representation in Congress. Instead I seek solace in The Daily Show with John Stewart, a little corner in our peculiar political universe that offers sanity, civility, and humor.</p>

			 <p>I had planned to finish my grading yesterday, but that has to happen today. I was just too exhausted. Looking at the wreckage around me that is my apartment, I wondered why. I also wondered about the incredibly fast passage of time. Ten weeks of a daily intensive history course in the afternoon (in two consecutive parts) and two four-week evening courses, three hours per evening, three evenings per week, with a three-hour minimum round trip commute on top of that help to explain both my exhaustion and temporal dislocation. But that came on top of twenty weeks non-stop ESL teaching at another place, sixteen of those weeks including morning and evening work. And I have continued my Saturday ESL. In other words, I have just finished thirty six-day weeks of teaching, with the exception of two days off over Memorial Day weekend and three days for the Fourth.</p>
<p>If this actually amounted to a living income in the DC area, I could be happy. Instead, it just lets me almost get by, sort of, because it is all paid by the course (history) or hour (ESL). Of course, in these economic times, survival is a pretty good achievement too. And I do like <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2009/07/23/miracle-workers-by.html">what I do</a>.</p>
<p>There is a ton of planning to do for Mason this fall, because I will have three sections of Western Civ with fifty-five students each. I am supposed to have a grader for ten hours per week, which will lighten the burden, but I have to plan in such a way that I can survive if the grader doesn’t come through. The early morning section will be a killer, because of the commute, but I am looking forward to a semester with all the teaching in the same part of the day, in this case from morning until early afternoon. Putting that aside, though, I have three whole weeks where I can work but not commute or manage a classroom. I really need that.</p>

			 <p>The Bush administration seems to have been more freaked out by 9/11 than I realized. Just how far down a paranoid path it had drifted is demonstrated by the newest revelation of a measure it was contemplating back in 2002: <a href="https://archive.ph/MTqTC">using the military to arrest terror suspects in the United States</a>. Bush ultimately went against it, but that it was even contemplated creates an image of a very frightened White House. Of course, Dick Cheney and John Yoo had their hand in this, so legal traditions and our political culture were not major impediments.</p>

			 <p>Our weekly <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2008/03/16/orange-juice-apple.html">farm share</a> feeds two people with room to spare, and often it works okay for three. There is less diversity than at the grocery store, because we eat what is in season, but a lot is in season in the summer. Yesterday’s share was particularly amazing: Asian greens, salad mix, spinach, kale, spring onions, cauliflower, beets with greens, zucchini, broccoli, kohlrabi, and turnips. These items from our farm were supplemented with couscous, black beans, maple yogurt, shell peas, and blueberries. Yummy!</p>
<p>Yesterday morning was my turn to help count out and set up the food for something like 200 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090625045137/http://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/pubs/csa/csa.shtml">CSA</a> members. It was hot, so I don’t remember the exact number, but it was a lot. Still, five of us (including my wife) managed to get the bulk of the work done in something like three hours. Of course, this does not count all the organizational and logistical work to get the food there in the first place, or the work done on the farm.</p>
<p>The results are fantastic. High quality food that is good for the earth at affordable prices, and I get to work with good people too.</p>

Sure, Khamenei has the instruments of oppression at his disposal. He can use the state and vigilante citizens to crack down on the protesters, and he might even win the day. In the end, however, he has made all too clear that the democratic elements of the system are no more than window dressing. Instead of sacrificing his preferred candidate, he is now risking the entire system. How can it now escape the opposition that the president is not the problem, but the entire system itself?</p>

			 <p>It seems to me that Iran’s clerical leadership is playing a dangerous game. The main opposition candidate is a conservative political insider who supports the current system, but who looks moderate in an Iranian context. His supporters are not demanding a change to the system either. They too just want the system to live up to its own official standards. But as time passes, expectations and goals might very easily expand to a vision that is even more at odds with what Iran’s clerical leadership wants for the country. Shouldn’t they concede before this happens?</p>
<p>One problem is that the opposition wants a new election, because the one they just had is tainted. But what would a new election mean? Among other things, more national discourse on the future of the country, and I suspect such a conversation would lead people to probe even deeper into the country’s problems, perhaps even to their systemic foundation, even if politicians are not allowed to question the country’s political system.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ahmadinejad’s supporters could become increasingly insistent about their desires, and that could easily undermine Iran’s social stability still further. Time is not on the side of those who support the status quo. Unfortunately, that does not mean it is on the side of the opposition.</p>

			 <p>The jury is still out on whether or not Mahmoud Ahmadinejad really won the election and, if so, to what extent. How this will play out is also anybody’s guess. One thing I already find worrying, however, is Ahmadinejad’s rhetoric, which talks about freedom and bipartisanship, on one hand, and delegitimizes legitimate political opposition, on the other. The following combination of quotes from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/14/AR2009061400385.html">today’s <em>Washington Post</em></a> is chilling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This election was so free that you could say it was complete freedom.… The election is gone and done. It is time for friendship, coalition and building the country.… [Reporters should talk to] true Iranians . . . Like the people you meet at my rallies.… [As for the opposition,] There is no other choice than to surrender… You think you are of the elite? That you are above the people? … The society must be purified of these people.… They will try to stop me, but I will expose them to the great nation of Iran.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first statement rings hollow. What is “complete freedom,” especially in the Iranian system where unelected religious leaders determines who may run for office? The second statement sounds eminently reasonable, something like a well-wishing plea for bipartisanship in the United States. Then things get spooky. It is one thing to demonize the other side as not truly patriotic. We experienced that last fall with Sarah Palin’s rhetoric of “real America,” the “media elite,” and so on. While I find such rhetoric reprehensible, at least it did not come right out and say that the other side had no right to exist. It understood the concept of a loyal opposition, even if that opposition supposedly loves America less than Palin’s and McCain’s supporters do.</p>
<p>If Ahmadinejad’s legitimately won the election, which is far from clear, his rhetoric shows that he has no respect for democratic processes. Elections without the concept of a loyal opposition are meaningless. Here’s hoping that Iran’s Supreme Leader gets that.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will. After all, the oppositional candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, was screened and approved by religious authorities. We are talking about opposition that is legitimate within the narrow confines of Iran’s political system, not our own. If even that is not acceptable, then what will be left of Iran’s revolution? Iranian independence, to be sure, as well as clerical rule and possibly the more extensive subjugation of women, but what about the semi-democratic elements of its constitution? The campaign, polling, and post-election protests suggest that they matter to Iranians. And well they should. The legitimacy of Iran’s post-1979 system depends on them.</p>

As bad as this number is, it is still comforting to think about how it is “only” in the single digits. Yet this number does not account for the huge number of self-employed professionals and tradespeople in this country who are unable to file an unemployment claim, even though they are effectively unemployed. And what about those of us who cobble together a series of temporary and part-time jobs that fill up our hours with work, but which do not amount to a job that is eligible for unemployment benefits when some of those gigs fall through? What about the underemployed? My gut and my own experience tells me that that 8.9% number is way too low.</p>

			 <p>On the front page of today’s Washington Post, one can read the following headline:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Effectiveness Of Harsh Questioning Is Unclear</strong><br>
Detainee May Have Faced Few Traditional Tactics</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This language bothers me. We are talking about torture here, so why not use the term? Why downgrade it to “harsh questioning” and even make it sound innovative, which comes to mind as the opposite of “traditional”? A story broadcast by On the Media this week shows that the Washington Post is not alone in this. Apparently the media is following the Obama administration’s lead.</p>
<p>I understand the administration’s position, because it is hoping this dark cloud will go away and not overshadow its policy agenda. Nonetheless, I do not understand how the administration could possibly believe that it will go away. The administration needs to get ahead of the story, even if it feels it can’t prejudice any possible criminal cases by calling it torture.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is no reason why newspapers have to toe the line on what language to use. The mere existence of definitions of what could and could not be done does not mean that the interrogation techniques used by the CIA were any less torture.</p>

			 <p>On December 28th, I began the first draft of a blog piece thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to stop thinking of terrorism as the disease and look at it instead as a symptom. In illnesses we have to treat unacceptably dangerous symptoms too, such as a high fever, but in the end we have to go to the root causes of the disease.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I never got any further with these ideas, and now, with President Obama, perhaps I don’t need to. What a difference the past few months have made!</p>
<p>Unlike the Bush administration, the Obama administration does not use the term &ldquo;Global War on Terror.&rdquo; I believe that this is not only a cosmetic change to differentiate the current administration from the previous one. Instead it constitutes recognition of the fact that terror is one part of a host of other problems, which differ according to region. The matrix of the Taliban, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, for instance, raises a rather different set of challenges than does Iraq or Iran or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even if they overlap in significant ways. Of course, the fight against terrorists will continue, but the new administration is no longer attempting to squeeze the broad set of foreign policy and security challenges it faces into the &ldquo;Global War on Terror&rdquo; rubric, which seemed to give the previous administration a bad case of tunnel vision.</p>

<p>America’s heartless terrorism<br>
Killing people like insects<br>
But honor doesn’t fear power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These sobering lines making the rounds in some parts of Pakistan raise troubling questions about our use of drones to bomb extremists in that country’s tribal regions. (See Mark Mazzetti’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/weekinreview/15MAZZETTI.html">&ldquo;The Downside of Letting Robots Do the Bombing&rdquo;</a> in today’s New York Times.) While I am not sure how to interpret them, I am reminded of how effective the rhetoric of honor was for the insurgency in Iraq, until the U.S. developed a more hands-on approach under General Petraeus. I’m not trying to make a policy suggestion, mind you. Iraq and Afghanistan are two very different places. I am simply struck by the powerful role that an injured sense of honor can play among populations that might feel like David in the face of Goliath.</p>

			 <p>I’ve made a little more progress in my <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2009/03/04/great-war-course.html">Great War course</a> thanks to the early deadlines for book orders. We can’t cover as many books as I might have liked because of the compressed time period: three three-hour meetings per week for one month. I can’t fill all that time with lectures either, for then the main question would be who succumbs to fatigue first, me from speaking or the students from listening. More depth and less breadth is my goal, though the reading schedule will remain rigorous.</p>
<p>We’re going to do four major units with six books. First, there will be the origins question with <em>July 1914: Soldiers, Statesmen, and the Coming of the Great War</em> by Samuel R. Williamson, Jr. and Russel Van Wyk (Bedford/St. Martin’s 2003). We’ll supplement this documentary history with the first chapter of <em>The First World War</em> by Hew Strachan (Penguin 2005) Second, we will use several classes to cover the course of the global conflict using Strachan’s survey together with the personal narratives in <em>Intimate Voices from the First World War</em> by Svetlana Palmer and Sarah Wallis (HarperCollins 2005). Third, we will use Modris Eksteins’ <em>Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age</em> (Anchor 1990) to consider the cultural impact of the war. Finally, we will look more closely at the war in two countries with <em>Imperial Germany and the Great War by Roger Chickering</em> (Cambridge 1998) and <em>France and the Great War</em> by Leonard V. Smith, Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, and Annette Becker (Cambridge 2003).</p>
<p>I might add some articles or online sources when I write the syllabus, and students will get a broader feel for the literature through brief oral book presentations at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>Because students will need a little time to begin reading in the first place, I will begin the class by looking at a selection of classic films. There could also be a lecture at the beginning on broader trends in war and society, although I’m tempted to forego that in favor of students raising related questions during discussions.</p>
<p>Incentives for students to read will be not only the subject matter and two short papers, but also a midterm and final exam. While I am no big fan of exams in history courses, many undergraduate students seem to need this carrot and stick. They might even appreciate it, though I would expect none to admit as much.</p>
<p>What happens during classroom time will depend largely on class size. The theoretical upper limit is 45, but I’m told 25 is more usual in the summer. Even that would be too large for meaningful discussions, so I’m thinking about what kind of discussions among small groups of students could occur within the larger classroom, with the groups then reporting results to the class as a whole. I have little experience with this setup in history; however, I regularly use the technique when teaching English to non-native speakers. I believe that this student-centered approach could be applied to history, in which learning historical thinking and a new topic is also about doing. Students need to read, think about, and discuss history in order to make it their own. Discussions in small groups could significantly increase the amount of practice that each student gets in a larger class.</p>
<p>Integrating these student-centered discussions into classroom time should also help with the pacing of each three-hour evening session. There will be more variety for everyone, and time usually passes more quickly for students when they are actively engaged in the class.</p>

			 <p>One small milestone: I told myself I should start walking to my current job in Arlington, and I actually did it today. I walked about a half hour downhill to Key Bridge in Georgetown. Then there was the trip up a hill in Arlington on the other side of the river. The walk in this direction was only 47 minutes, but coming back was closer to an hour, because I took a detour across Georgetown University’s campus, mistakenly believing it was a shortcut. Getting to Arlington with public transport involves two to three busses, depending on my route, so the walk didn’t cost me much extra time. Sure, I couldn’t read the newspaper, but thinking and exercising are more important anyway. Besides, it’s spring.</p>

			 <p>George Mason&rsquo;s Hist 100 courses are supposed to cover Western Civilization in one semester. To manage this Sisyphean task, I switched from a chronological to a thematic approach. While this makes sense from an analytic point of view, covering themes seems to alienate some students, because the themes appear in the foreground, not the events and personalities. Moreover, the themes tend to bridge larger periods of time. With &ldquo;Religion and Society,&rdquo; for instance, I cover the Investiture Conflict, the Protestant and Catholic Reformations, the Wars of Religion, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment. And &ldquo;War and Society&rdquo; goes from the French Revolution through the Second World War into the Cold War.</p>
<p>The material in my thematic courses has been organized in a more meaningful way than was possible under a broad chronological approach, but it has not held students' attention. That is why I am thinking about covering a selection of specific episodes the next time around. I could put these up front and use the people, ideas, and issues involved as a vehicle to understand the broader themes that I want them to learn. A possible subtitle for such a course might be &ldquo;Select Events and Ideas,&rdquo; which might also make the history feel more manageable to the students.</p>

			 <p>I still need to work out the details, but here’s my catalog description for one course I am teaching this summer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hist 388-C02 - The Great War</p>
<p>Some 9 to 10 million people lost their lives in the Great War between 1914 and 1918. Most of the dead were soldiers; however, the war affected the lives of nearly everyone, not only because of the mass mourning it inspired, but also because of its economic, social, cultural and political consequences. Why did Europe’s great powers go to war? Why did they keep fighting? How did soldiers and civilians experience the war? What were its consequences? This course seeks to explore the First World War, a total war, from as many angles as possible, including politics, diplomacy, strategy, tactics, economics, class, gender, generation, and nationality. The course will center on discussions of assigned readings, which will feel heavy during this short term. We will also consider some films. Grades will be based on class participation, two short papers, a short book presentation, and a midterm and final exam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The particular challenge with this course is the intensive summer format George Mason University uses. The course meets for about three hours, three times per week for one month.</p>

			 <p>I ended the year with some political fatigue, so I have not been writing much about politics lately. Let’s face it. The campaign was a long one. I continue to be interested in politics, but I cannot be bothered to follow every little political squabble, especially not as it is currently being reported.</p>
<p>Right now each major issue appears in the media as a case of <em>the Democrats say</em> versus <em>the Republicans say,</em> and, quite frankly, I don’t really care what the Republicans are saying, not with their current tactic of doing nothing but say no in a situation where inaction is not an option. I’m more interested in learning how concrete decisions are being made, with or without the GOP. Not surprisingly then, I enjoyed Roger Simon’s opinion piece in Politico today,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090306210333/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19534.html">&ldquo;Obama’s bold. What did you expect?&quot;</a></p>
<p>One other thing has kept me from editorializing here more of late. The sheer size and complexity of the economic and foreign policy tasks facing us defies easy answers. Fortunately, we have an administration that gets that, even as it moves forward with amazing speed.</p>

			 <p>Due to budget cuts, George Mason University did not book me ahead of time to teach history courses this semester. Hence, I took a couple more ESL courses at LADO. Of course, the History Department at Mason offered me something right before its semester started, but I was already working at LADO by that time. Saying no to LADO at the beginning of January on the mere chance of work at Mason was not an option.</p>
<p>The downside is money. Of course, that’s always an issue for teachers, but it’s particularly difficult for people teaching at private language schools. Universities pay adjunct professors by the course, which leaves financial gaps between semesters, but which also leaves time for other part-time jobs. ESL schools pay only by the hours one actually teaches, meaning five hours of actual teaching is only a “part-time” job, never mind preparation time.</p>
<p>Another downside is my crazy schedule. Besides teaching ESL in my DC neighborhood on Saturday mornings, as I did most of 2008, I am teaching mornings in Arlington and evenings in DC. This schedule can be a little disorienting, not to mention tiring. It has an upside too, however, insofar as it leaves me time during the day for job hunting. The trick is to switch gears between the classroom and this other side of my life, and to remember that the actual job search is the most important thing. That’s not easy for a teacher whose natural inclination is to give his classes the highest priority.</p>
<p>One practical upside to my current routine is the lack of long trips out to Fairfax. I have also been enjoying the break in my routine. Teaching ESL to students at a private language school often means the students really want to learn. They can see how the material affects their ability to interact with their environment, unlike students who take an introductory history class simply because it is mandated by the university.</p>
<p>It’s also fun meeting people from so many countries. Lumping my current courses together, my students come from Mexico, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Bolivia, Brazil, Poland, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Thailand, Japan, Algeria, Libya, and Saudi Arabia. Many of them work as au pairs or nannies, and some come from the diplomatic community.</p>
<p>This summer I’m scheduled to teach Euro Civ I and II again at Georgetown University. I’ve also got two history courses at George Mason University, Western Civ again and also one on the Great War. The courses at each university are intensive, but they come one after the other, so I won’t be teaching more than two intensive history courses at a time, though I might also continue with the Saturday course at LADO.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the search for a full-time job must pick up. It might be at university, but I am seriously considering history at private schools as well as possibly something that matches my skills in the government. The State Department could make sense, especially as a foreign service officer who does public diplomacy. Unfortunately, the process for getting that kind of job can take a very long time, as much as two years, if I understand correctly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, life goes on.</p>

			 <p>On Sunday, January 18th, we attempted to see the concert at Lincoln Memorial. We took a bus down Wisconsin Avenue and got off at Foggy Bottom. Walking towards the memorial, we soon joined a mass of humanity heading in the same direction.</p>
<p>There was good will and a sense of expectation in the air. Unfortunately, there was also only one hour till the concert’s begin, and we had badly underestimated the time it would take to get through security. Exacerbating the situation were people cutting the lines, sometimes willfully, sometimes because the architecture of the lines was confusing.</p>
<p>We decided to give up at 2:00, when the concert was supposed to begin. We could chock it up to experience and be better prepared on Tuesday. Besides, just seeing the expectant crowds was a good thing. We also decided to walk to Memorial Bridge via Washington Monument, thinking we could at least see the crowds—and maybe hear some sounds—across the water. It turned out, however, that there were JumboTrons and loudspeakers at Washington Monument, no security checkpoints to go through, and the concert had not yet begun. We got within one or two hundred yards of a JumboTron and saw the whole thing from within a growing sea of humanity that reached as far back as the eye could see. The monument is on a hill, which means the crowd from my vantage point looked endless, since my view at the scene behind us reached only the monument, dropping off like the ocean does on the horizon at sea.</p>
<p>I choked up while singing the national anthem at the beginning. Catharsis. Healing after eight years of a leader who encouraged us to follow our worst instincts. The sense of joy and anticipation around me was palpable. We sang and we danced. Catharsis. Having the eighty-nine-year-old Pete Seeger there at the end made it that much sweeter—so did the whole choreography of the show, which brought not only different ethnicities on stage together, but also generations and genres. Garth Brooks’ singing “Shout!” was fine example of this tendency.</p>
<p>Afterwards we walked half of the way or more back home, though we found room in a bus for part of the trip. We talked with other passengers as if we all knew each other, which happens in DC, but seldom this easily.</p>
<p>That evening, my wife convinced me to volunteer for service the next day as Obama had been encouraging citizens to do, but my earlier hesitation meant all organized activities were already booked. So instead we signed up for a pledge drive next month for our local public radio station, which I had been planning to do anyway. And I reminded my wife of her other volunteering. She’s always been much better then me at stepping up when help is needed.</p>
<p>So Monday was a day at home. Sure, there were special events for the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday, but the next day would take a lot of energy and planning.</p>
<p>Told we had to choose between inauguration and the parade, and told the parade had security checkpoints, but a spot on the Mall for inauguration didn’t, the choice was easy. Moreover, being there was more important than having a chance to see Obama in the parade. What better way to bear witness than with two million people?</p>
<p>The decision to brave the crowds was easier, because we live in Glover Park, which is close enough to make it possible to avoid packed Metro stations.</p>
<p>This morning we took a bus to Dupont Circle and walked to Washington Monument. We left the apartment at 8:00 and had a spot with a view of a JumboTron by 9:00. They rebroadcast the concert to distract us, and they showed us the arriving guests. The wait passed by pretty quickly this way.</p>
<p>Our long-johns and other layers kept us reasonably comfortable. So did a folded yoga mat (for both sitting and standing on) and snacks and tea. The more crowded it got, the less the wind bit into us, though the breeze never completely went away on that small hill.</p>
<p>The mood reminded me of the Sunday concert, except we got past the anticipation to the main event. At times it felt like at a church, as some neighbors from Newport News responded to parts of the president’s speech with a rhythmic refrain of “Okay,” as if in a conversation with him. An “Amen” even slipped from my lips a couple times, including at the part where Obama denounced the false choice between security and our values. I was doubly impressed then when that Obama line drew a lot of extra cheers and applause where we were standing.</p>
<p>There will be more to ponder in the coming days and weeks. Right now I am exhausted from the cold and windy, but beautiful walk back from Washington Monument across to Lincoln Memorial, along the Potomac to Georgetown, and up Wisconsin Avenue to Glover Park. (Were we ever stiff after a short bathroom break at Barnes &amp; Noble in Georgetown and then coffee at a small cafe on Wisconsin Avenue!)</p>
<p>Tired, beat, exhausted—the good kind.</p>

While we know how to tag for our own use, we are much worse at it as a collective. To make this point she looks at how people tagged their photographs of a mosaic bull upon whose testicles one can spin for good luck.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Juan Cole offers some interesting historical perspective on Israel&rsquo;s wars in a piece called &ldquo;Gaza 2008: Micro-Wars and Macro-Wars.&rdquo; Here is one of his more provocative assessments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s political tradition seeks expansion if possible; if not possible, it seeks a balance of power with its enemies. If that is not possible, it seeks to be held harmless from its avowed foes. If that is not possible, it is willing to wage total war to punish the enemy population until it accepts at least a cold peace. Where necessary, Israel is willing to give up territorial expansion to get the cold peace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If only I knew what &ldquo;total war&rdquo; means here. In modern European history it was when the distinction between soldiers and civilians was increasingly erased during the First and Second World Wars. If Israel sometimes erases such distinctions in urban situations, I am not aware of a policy that accepts this erasure, especially not for its own civilians. Presumably Cole has something else in mind or is using hyperbole, either way demonstrating how slippery the term &ldquo;total war&rdquo; can be.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;cold peace&rdquo;? Well, the Cold War was a rhetorical war in the metropoles and a shooting war in other countries by proxy; however, it was otherwise a peace, albeit one punctuated by extreme levels of militarization that the push of a button could have transformed into the first real total war. Perhaps then &ldquo;cold war&rdquo; in a generic sense means a war with no shooting. Does &ldquo;cold peace&rdquo; mean a peace marked by periodic violence? If so, I have not noticed any particular willingness by Israel to accept this violence. Or is this about an icy peace punctuated by the permanent threat of violence? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a cold war then?</p>
<p>Putting aside the overly generous use of unexplained labels, Cole&rsquo;s article is worth reading, whether or not you agree with his take on &ldquo;Israel&rsquo;s old expansionist tendencies.&rdquo; The historical context is useful, and the term &ldquo;micro-wars&rdquo; is at least consistent with the metaphor upon which &ldquo;asymmetric war&rdquo; depends, though it encompasses more dimensions than merely partisan warfare. Cole points to four specific factors in the twenty-first century: (1) the integration of the religious political parties Hamas and Hizbullah with the population around them via the parties' social services; (2) suicide bombs, tank-piercing capabilities, and small rocket fire; (3) the support of a regional power (a common feature of other guerilla wars); and (4) &ldquo;Israel&rsquo;s Achilles heel, its demographic vulnerability&rdquo;—a violent environment encourages emigration. Cole uses these factors as the backdrop for his narrative of Israel&rsquo;s conflicts in Southern Lebanon and Gaza.</p>
<p>In the end, though, he wonders if global opinion might prove a bigger problem for Israel, albeit only in the long term. Public opinion is the one thing I&rsquo;ve been wondering about as well.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;macro-war&rdquo;? Does Cole mean the old conventional wars that Israel used to fight with its neighbors? Or is he talking about global public opinion, which is the focus of Israel&rsquo;s and its enemies' propaganda wars and public diplomacy?</p>

			 <p>In "<a href="http://www.martynemko.com/articles/americas-most-overrated-product-higher-education_id1539">America's Most Overrated Product: the Bachelor's Degree</a>," Marty Nemko argues, "College is a wise choice for far fewer people than are currently encouraged to consider it." Looking at my <a title="A New Personal Record in Plagiarism Cases" href="http://markstoneman.com/2008/12/21/a-new-personal-record-in-plagiarism-cases/">plagiarism rate</a> from last semester and considering the number of students at <a href="http://gmu.edu/">George Mason University</a> who fail the mandatory History 100 survey simply because they do not show up or turn in their work, I have to admit that he has a point. He argues that high school students in the bottom half of their class should think twice before entering a four-year college. A two-year college or non-degree program might be more appropriate. He bases this advice on the following disheartening finding: "Among high-school students who graduated in the bottom 40 percent of their classes, and whose first institutions were four-year colleges, two-thirds had not earned diplomas eight and a half years later." And they were piling up debt.</p>
<p>Part of the problem, he says, relates to the quality of teaching. Class size, for example, is a problem. How much attention can I give each student in a fifty-person lecture course that sometimes meets for "small" group discussions of twenty-five students? My classroom experience, however, suggests that something else is also at work. There seems to be some kind of cultural or educational gap that has not prepared some of my students for the university classroom and university assignments. There are always a handful of students who expect every lecture to be both entertaining and amusing to every student in the classroom. Whatever happened to students just putting up with something that doesn't interest them personally and learning about it anyway? What about basic curiosity and giving something a chance? This past semester two young men surreptitiously texted each other during a forty-five-minute excerpt from Chaplin's hilarious "Modern Times." Is there any hope that such students will ever be interested in anything in the classroom?</p>
<p>And what about those students who feel that reading assignments are an imposition, as if everything worth knowing were available on <a title="Professor Wikipedia (video)" href="http://clioandme.wordpress.com/2008/09/26/professor-wikipedia/">Wikipedia</a> or a comparable website? True story: I had a student this semester who preferred to read email and texts on her smart phone instead of listening to the lecture. Usually when students do this, they try to be discrete about it, even if their facial expressions give them away. This student, however, held the phone up in front of her face so there could be no mistaking where her attention was. When I spoke to her about it another time, she said she was using the phone for the internet so she could bring something to the discussion. I told her I knew the little bit that was on the internet for our subject and that I was more interested in her own thoughts on the assigned book. She was flabbergasted.</p>
<p>These complaints of mine can lead to a slippery slope. I can't forget all the hard-working, disciplined, and curious students I know. I don't want to succumb to the cynicism that pervades <a href="http://rateyourstudents.blogspot.com/">Rate Your Students</a>, a blog where some academics vent about their students and colleagues. It really is up to me to make the best I can out of a situation, even for the Sisyphean task of teaching the required one-semester survey in Western Civilization. Indeed, I think I've become a better teacher for these experiences. Still, Marty Nemko has a point, even if the fault does not just lie with institutions selling the dream of a four-year degree. There is clearly a gulf separating the expectations of a portion of the student body from the expectations that they encounter in the classroom. While many colleges and universities need to be more student-centered, prospective students need to consider whether a four-year college is the right choice for them. It is for many people, but not for everyone.</p>

<hr>
<p>An essay on the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) that I wrote last year appeared in print this fall in a book about war atrocities from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century.<sup id="fnref-1767-1"><a class="jetpack-footnote" href="#fn-1767-1">1</a></sup> The essay focuses on German soldiers and French civilians using the example of the Bavarians. It examines why soldiers sometimes departed from generally accepted standards in Europe about sparing civilians the effects of war as much as possible.</p>
<p>The war began as a "cabinet war" that the German leadership hoped to win quickly through a series of decisive battles of annihilation. In this way the state, led by the king and his cabinet, would maintain control over the war effort and not face any undue influence from civilians, whether its own or those of the enemy. After destroying the Second Empire's army at Sedan, however, France refused to capitulate. Its people toppled the empire and vowed to fight on. The German leadership had a "people's war" on its hands that it took five more months to win. While the French and Germans fought most of this war with conventional means between armed forces organized by the state, the war also saw substantial civilian involvement that had the potential to lead to an ever deepening spiral of violence.</p>
<p>The most extensive contact between soldiers and civilians occurred as a result of the German military policy of living off the land, which made German forces more mobile. To maintain discipline, officers were supposed to take small details of soldiers to requisition what animals, fodder, and food their units required. Requisitioning resembled theft in that those whose property the German officers took had no choice in the matter, but it differed insofar as the German officers issued receipts for what they took. These would be paid off by whichever side lost. German forces were also quartered on civilian households. These circumstances enabled soldiers to pursue their own private initiatives. If their "hosts" would not give them what they needed, the soldiers often took it.</p>
<p>More famous, however, were reports of armed French civilians called francs-tireurs. While their number was not great enough to present a strategic threat, the German forces did have to devote some 120,000 soldiers to their lines of communication. Armed incidents led the invading soldiers to shoot suspected partisans summarily, burn down houses and even villages where such incidents occurred, and use hostages, most famously on locomotives. While some reactions had an ad hoc quality to them, the common thread was the notion of "military necessity." The German forces found the actions regrettable but necessary, in order to prevent the war from lasting longer than necessary. The idea was to counter French "terror" with measures so harsh that the French would see the error of their ways and refrain from any further resistance.</p>
<p>References for these incidents and the historiography of the Franco-Prussian War are available in this new essay as well as the following related one, in which I devote a lot of space to the events in Bazailles, which the Bavarians infamously burned down during the Battle of Sedan: "The Bavarian Army and French Civilians in the War of 1870–1871: A Cultural Interpretation," <em>War in History</em> 8.3 (2001): 271–93.</p>
<p>My source base for this research was published personal narratives, that is, letters, diaries, and memoirs. Most of them came from Bavarian soldiers and officers, though I drew on other German narratives by way of comparison. It is in some ways surprising how freely the fighting men wrote about these events, but what they were describing was either acceptable in their minds or told in relation to what lines they believed the French had crossed.</p>
<p>One phenomenon I found little mention of was the hostage-taking. This might be because the Bavarian veterans felt they had crossed a line, although it is also worth noting that their units were not as heavily involved in maintaining lines of communication in the rear, which is where the hostage-taking occurred. Recently I learned more about this subject from <a href="http://www.hsozkult.de/hfn/publicationreview/id/rezbuecher-10944">Heidi Mehrkens' new book</a>, which includes a section on the German military using hostages on locomotives. Mehrkens' book is also helpful, because it uses archival sources that confirm the impressions I gained about relations between soldiers and civilians from the published primary sources.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I had a new personal record in plagiarism cases this semester: eight. With ninety-seven students total on my rolls at the end of the semester, that makes a little over 8%. To be absolutely clear, I am talking about open-and-shut cases. The burden of proof is on the professor, as it should be, so I never report any honor system violations based merely on my suspicions, no matter how strong they might be.</p>
<p>Some of the cases stem from this semester's new <a title="Lessons from the Classroom [Clio and Me]" href="http://markstoneman.com/2008/08/26/lessons-from-the-classroom/">bibliography project</a>. In the past I had tried to craft integrative essay assignments that made plagiarism impossible or very difficult, but I had wanted to move beyond text analysis and writing to also cover research skills, which have proven to be a major deficit among many of my students. I had thought a bibliography project would invite less plagiarism than a straight research paper, since I have not seen bibliography essays for sale on the internet. I was right about buying a finished product, but not about preventing plagiarism. Feeling overwhelmed, a few students panicked and opted to copy and paste material they found on the internet. These examples were the clumsiest. I also saw some examples where students worked harder to integrate internet material than they would have had to work, had they simply opened some books and summarized their contents. I saw both types of behavior on the other essay assignments too.</p>
<p>What happens to these students depends on whether it is their first or second offense. The first offenses that I have seen have led to a zero for the assignment in question. Since these are often worth 25% of the course grade, students found guilty of their first honor system violation have to work hard just to earn a "D" in the course. Second offenses have led to failure of the course. Perhaps there were also other sanctions for second-time offenders that I do not know about.</p>
<p>The high number of plagiarism cases has made me wonder what I could change about assignments and assessment in future. Since I am not slated to teach this spring, I have some time to mull this over. Meanwhile, what are your thoughts and experiences?</p>

			 <p>I just cooked some bok choy and something similar whose name I don’t know. I won’t be eating these greens tonight, but they were getting old and needed cooking. I used more water than was probably necessary, which left me with some good stock for a soup. Tonight, however, was one of those nights when the stock didn’t get saved. Instead I just drank it. It is amazing how much flavor goes into the water. Presumably some nutrients are in there too, though I was just in it for the flavor and warmth.</p>
<p>I’m pretty simple when it comes to things like this. Maybe sometime I’ll look for recipes, but usually the food from my farm share tastes good without doing more than cooking up vegetables and potatoes or rice, or maybe making a soup out of what is on hand. This afternoon I did that with some white turnips, carrots, Brussels sprouts, an onion, a potato, and some homemade noodles from my CSA. I used some vegetarian bouillon from Rapunzel too, since I am not methodical enough with saving vegetable stock. I have found, however, that the vegetables from my CSA have so much flavor that I need much less bouillon than usual, one half to a third of what the directions call for.</p>

			 <p>It’s the end of a long day, or rather the beginning of a new one, if the passing of midnight means anything. Two squash pies are doing their thing in the oven. These were long in the making. I washed a bunch of dishes and cooked the squash this morning. Usually I make the pies for Thanksgiving with canned pumpkin, but we had the biodynamic squash from our farm share, so I did it the old-fashioned way. This included washing and laying out the seeds to dry. (They’ll make a good snack.) Afterwards, I did my weekly food run to Bethesda, where my CSA is. This evening I filled in for someone at LADO, where I’m teaching English to non-native speakers. Then I came back home, took a break, and began converting the cooked squash into two pies. I have leftover pie mixture too, so I’ll make more tomorrow or Friday.</p>
<p>In case you’re wondering, I used a recipe called Dolly’s Pumpkin Pie in Uprisings: The Whole Grain Bakers’ Book (p. 199). This is the same book that taught me how to <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2008/01/15/baking-bread.html">bake whole grain bread</a>.</p>

			 <p>People who ride busses have to spend time waiting. I often use the time to think or read, but sometimes I observe the world around me while allowing myself simply to be. And sometimes I pull out a notepad and write down my thoughts.</p>
<p>The sun has started shining differently in the morning and evening. It’s lower in the sky, and it lends a different light to the objects it touches. The colors change, as if they were in pictures printed from slides. (What was the name of that process, when we made pictures from slides, which were basically the opposite of negatives?)</p>
<p>When the sunlight is like this, it becomes a pleasure to let it shine into my eyes as I almost—but not quite—look into it. It carries something that my being craves, the stuff of good moods and a friendly disposition, which can too easily go into hiding when days grow shorter and the nights longer. (How do people survive without the sun in the far north?) During much of the year I go out of my way to be in the shade, but this sun is different. It will disappear soon, giving way to the cold wind and darkness, but not before it has given me the strength I need for a journey in the cold tonight, after the warm feeling and my memory of it have passed.</p>

			 <p class="intro">This post originally appeared on Language for You (now closed) on this date under a slightly different title.</p>
<p>When learning a foreign language, it is important to practice daily or even more frequently than that. Many readers will say, "But I don't have time for that!" Sure you do! Really. You just have to let go of the habit of doing a lot of homework and studying all in one long weekly session. Do many short sessions instead. If you only have two hours a week to devote to learning a new language, you could break part of that time up into shorter chunks. You could, for example, take one hour for a long study session. And then you could divide the other hour into four 15-minute sessions. That would give you a total of five sessions in a week. Add to that the class you are probably taking, and you are up to six sessions per week. That will give you the repetition you need to make new words, grammar, and habits of thought sink in. This little amount of time is not ideal. More studying is desirable, but it will bring you a better return on your investment than one long session per week.</p>
<p>Of course, once you get into the habit of these short study sessions, you will find that you can schedule more. What about the five or ten minutes you spend waiting for a bus or train? What about the time you spend on the train? What about when you're walking? You can't look at your books then, but you could look at flash cards with idioms, confusing words, or irregular verbs. You could also simply try thinking in the language you are learning. In this way, the two hours you spend learning the language will grow substantially without actually costing you extra time. And because you are studying frequently and regularly, your brain and mouth and ears will grow accustomed to the language more quickly.</p>
<p>And you know what? It can be fun. It takes your mind off your daily troubles and lets you accomplish something in a short period of time. Pretty soon you will notice that you can feel good about this activity, which gives you one more reason to feel good about yourself. These positive feelings will spark you to keep up and even expand this new study habit.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My Western Civ courses last winter and spring had some mandatory discussion components. Students had to visit the Holocaust Museum and talk about their experience online. I had them do the same with two old movies as well. (They chose from a list I had given them.) Both assignments went pretty well, except for a couple students who thought they only needed to copy and paste someone's words from an online movie review. The other downside to the assignment was assessment. <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/">Blackboard</a> gives precise statistics for each user, so it is possible to combine one's impression of the students' quality of effort with numbers. <a href="http://www.wikispaces.com/">Wikispaces</a>, which I like, did not offer these statistics. (It might for its <a title="Wikispaces" href="http://www.wikispaces.com/site/privatelabel">Private Label</a> version, but <a title="George Mason University" href="http://www.gmu.edu">my school</a> doesn't have that. I had to set up my own Wikispaces account.)</p>
<p>What was really interesting about the Wikispaces experience, however, was that students started using the discussion feature in other parts of the course. It wasn't mandatory, though I had told students I'd keep it in mind when doing their class participation grade. I've said the same thing to classes where I have used Blackboard, but without such positive results. The difference was related both to Wikispaces and the number of students involved.</p>
<p>Wikispaces lets people stay logged in on their laptops or desktop computers. That makes it really easy to check on a regular basis. Wikispaces also makes it easy to create course content that is easy to navigate. Blackboard makes creating course content much more difficult, at least that's been my experience with their folders. I put course content in them and then got all kinds of emails asking where the stuff was. I never had that happen on Wikispaces. Obviously, I could learn to use Blackboard more effectively, but that will cost me more time than I've had, and the process of building pages will continue to be clumsy and slow. Wikispaces is so much easier, especially with one learns it's easy markup, though that is not necessary.</p>
<p>My experience with Wikispaces forums was different for another reason, however. Last spring I put together all three courses on one Wiki. That gave me about 110 people. Since the course is required and not everyone is as interested in online participation, or even familiar with online forums, these numbers gave me the critical mass I needed to get self-sustaining discussions that did not require too much shepherding on my part.</p>
<p>By way of comparison, this fall I am using Blackboard again, because I did not feel like paying Wikispaces any money or dealing with student usernames. (Neither of these things would be an issue if the university bought the service for the whole campus.) The result has been mixed. I have not required online participation because of the bibliography project, but I was hoping to see a little discussion about the content of the course like I saw last spring. That has not been happening much. The problem, I think, is that while I have 95 students, they are split into two courses and therefore two places on Blackboard. (I should have asked for consolidation of the two.) This means I lost my critical mass. Also, logging into Blackboard is a pain in the neck. Not only can it not leave one signed in, but it insists on checking browser compatibility every single time. Why can't it just drop a cookie? And Firefox asks me every single time whether I trust the security certificate or not. (Using Safari is not even an option.) These minor things really get in the way, because logging in distracts the user from whatever she might have wanted to say. Adding insult to injury, Blackboard automatically logs one out after a certain amount of time has elapsed, which limits the utility of its note-taking and calendar functions. (I'm not sure how much time has to pass, but the automatic logout has happened to me a lot this semester.)</p>
<p>One other thing I've noticed is layout. Many students need teaching about threaded discussions, no matter what platform, it seems, but Blackboard's are just plain clunky next to Wikispaces'.</p>
<p>One important point to note about Wikispaces: The free version does not shield students' comments from the public, and it includes ads via Google AdSense in the right-hand bar. The instructor can gain privacy and get rid of the ads by paying $5.00 per month or $50.00 per year. That is good if one plans to recycle the same site. If not, the number of sites could grow. Sooner or later one will have to release the comments to the public and allow the ads. I knew this was going to happen, so I told students ahead of time that I would be opening the wiki at the end of the semester. I also offered to delete their names, though only one person took me up on that. Of course, none of this is an issue for universities with an enterprise edition. Also, teachers in primary and secondary education can obtain free wikis for their classes.</p>
<p>Bottom line? I wish more universities would buy <a href="http://www.wikispaces.com/site/privatelabel">Wikispaces Private Label</a>, which is between $1000 and $8000 per year, depending on levels of storage and service. I don't know what Blackboard costs, but I suspect this is a pretty cheap price that would make an invaluable tool available for student collaborative projects as well. And instructors would have control over their course websites and forums in a way that Blackboard users can only dream of. Of course, some instructors might be using Blackboard's testing features, which Wikispaces doesn't have, but I'm not.</p>
<p><strong>Update (1/7/2010):</strong> I have deleted the wiki initially linked to at the beginning of this post. As interesting as the experience was, I would like to maintain the privacy of the students, and I cannot afford the annual dues to password protect the thing. I do wish that the universities I teach for as an adjunct were subscribed to the enterprise version of Wikispaces.</p>

			 <p>I had high hopes for today. I had no grading to do or lecture to prepare. I could take off my teaching hat and devote the day to a lot of pressing personal business, especially job applications. But I was nearly immobile for much of the day. Why? It’s not like I haven’t taught long evening classes before, I thought. But then I did the math. This is the first semester I have taught a daytime class and a long evening class. That in itself might be unremarkable, but then there’s the commute too. So maybe I should not feel guilty about Thursdays and just accept that at the moment it is my weekend. After all, I spent last weekend grading, and that will happen next weekend too. And I am teaching English as a Foreign Language on Saturdays to a group of au pairs at a school in my neighborhood called LADO.</p>
<p>But back to that math. Yesterday I got up at 7:00 and left the house a little after 9:00. The commute by bus and train and bus is 90 minutes on a good day, though usually a little longer. I lectured from 11:30 to 12:20. I advised students on an upcoming project for the next hour. I had lunch and caught up on the news via the web. Then I updated Blackboard, the online learning system that George Mason University uses. I returned to the office at 5:00, an hour earlier than usual, because I figured I’d have more visitors than usual, which I did, right down to 7:10. At that point I had to quit advising students and deliver a lecture beginning at 7:20. I managed to end that early, that is, at 9:50, and then I answered student questions until 10:15. I caught a bus at 10:30. Waited 15 minutes for a train. Got into DC about 11:30 and waited for a bus. I got home about midnight. That’s 15 hours on the move. And it really is on the move, because adjunct professors at Mason only have access to office space for office hours. There is not enough room to give us a work space too.</p>
<p>So maybe it’s okay to be exhausted on Thursday, which really is my weekend this semester. One good thing: I’ve been able to ride the train during non-peak hours. Another: I’ve started doing yoga again, and I intend to keep that up, regardless of whatever crazy work schedule I might have in future.</p>

			 <p>After election night, a few hours’ sleep, and a fourteen-hour Wednesday (not including the late-night trip home from work I’m now on), I’m too tired to write a fresh blog post. Nonetheless, I’d like to share some of my impressions from election night shortly after McCain’s and Obama’s speeches. Here are two comments I wrote at one online forum. The first was on a thread from a guy convinced that Obama is really a socialist. The other was on an upbeat thread asking what Obama’s election meant for America. I share them here, because maybe at some point I will want to remember what I was thinking on that first night.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>McCain gave an excellent speech tonight. I hope all his supporters listen to it closely. I hope they listen to Obama’s too. New chapter, folks. Time to roll up the sleeves and get to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Obama gave a good speech yesterday that pointed to the tough challenges ahead of us. Instead of triumphalism he talked about the long road ahead. This attitude was clear from his voice and body language too. This is the kind of leadership I have been hoping for. No promises of fast and easy solutions. Just hard work for all of us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the campaign is over, and I can start thinking about other things again, like making a living.</p>

			 <p>A lot of people get angry or sad or both on 9/11. Of course, the loss of life in this country was horrible, but for me that date always brings up the manner in which Bush used Americans' sentiments to go to war against a country that had nothing to do with the attack, Iraq. And in this political season, it brings to mind how McCain was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080912063240/http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=13&amp;prgDate=9-4-2008">ahead of the curve</a> in calling for that war.</p>
<p>Call these sentiments mean-spirited, if you will. How dare I politick on this day of remembrance? Fair enough, but these sentiments have been with me for many years now. They are part of my 9/11, just as are the worries about friends in New York, the story of a colleague&rsquo;s husband who missed work that day and whose general was killed in the Pentagon office my colleague&rsquo;s husband usually also occupied, the tales told by people in my building streaming in from downtown reporting alleged bombs in cars around the city, the military helicopters and jets over the skies of DC and the absence of the usual noisy commercial airliners, a child sick at home and a wife working downtown, the activation of a friend in the DC National Guard for years of active duty in this city and Afghanistan, the quiet evening streets for weeks after the attack, the sudden departure of Arab students from my building because their parents back home feared for their safety, the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, the color-coded warnings, and the never-ending rhetoric and politics of fear.</p>
<p>Or talk about hindsight being twenty-twenty. Thing is, Bush didn&rsquo;t need hindsight. All he and his advisors needed was a sense of how countries have reacted to attacks in the past. As a historian, I claim no special insights into the future, but I frequently have a fair idea of what we should be paying attention to in the present. I&rsquo;m good at asking questions, even if my answers aren&rsquo;t always right. Here&rsquo;s what I told my shaken students in Washington, DC <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2007/09/11/six-years-ago.html">seven years ago</a>. And still we don&rsquo;t teach war and society as a fundamental aspect of the human experience in required undergraduate history courses. What a shame.</p>

			 <p>I can take the Republican crowd in Dayton on Friday chanting the name of their candidate enthusiastically (00:00 of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080905171722/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKByFPy7-RU">C-SPAN video</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JOHN MC CAIN<br>
JOHN MC CAIN<br>
JOHN MC CAIN</p>

<p>But I find it uncanny when the same crowd slips into a chant about the United States, eliding one three-syllable chant into another, the candidate into the country (23:00).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>U S A<br>
U S A<br>
U S A</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The aggressive tone is no different than the one many Americans use at the Olympics, a tone they consider harmless, because they don&rsquo;t suffer from any concerns about the public image of the Loud American overseas. Only this wasn&rsquo;t abroad, so there was no need to assert the supposed physical superiority of Americans in such a confrontational way, unless I were to interpret the chanting as support for John McCain&rsquo;s bellicose foreign policy rhetoric, which it was (21:48).</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t also help but feel that it was aimed at Democrats, who these people don&rsquo;t see as real Americans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>U S A<br>
U S A<br>
U S A</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John McCain stood there and beamed, as if acknowledging his and his supporters' open secret: only Republicans love their country. Of course, that statement is only true if patriotism equals bellicosity. But it doesn&rsquo;t. McCain would be a better man if he would acknowledge the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080905171722/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94087570">following statement</a> by Barack Obama. But he won&rsquo;t.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>. . . Let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a red America or a blue America &ndash; they have served the United States of America.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first.</p>

<p>It takes a true patriot to acknowledge the humanity in and ideals of one&rsquo;s political opponent</p>

			 <p>It is Labor Day in these United States of America. Observing this holiday became a bittersweet experience this morning, when Latin American workers showed up to take care of the garden outside my building, as if Labor Day was not for them too. On the other hand, allowing or forcing workers to observe this holiday would hurt them financially, because they would not be paid, just as millions of unorganized American workers are not being paid today. This circumstance is due in part to the weakness of organized labor in this country. Today I am also reminded of how most American media outlets treat news of Wall Street&rsquo;s welfare as a story about the general interest but news of organized labor as a special interest. Even worse, far too many American workers have internalized this way of thinking.</p>
<p>By the way, did you know that most of the world celebrates this day on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080905171722/http://clioandme.wordpress.com/2008/05/01/happy-may-day/">May 1st</a>?

			 <p>Last winter and spring I had my students write Wikipedia articles and then monitor those articles to see what edits other people made. The point was to give them a firmer appreciation of how this online resource works, so that they would understand its strengths and limitations. The Wikipedia projects were of varying quality, but I wasn't unhappy with them. The student feedback at the end of the semester also showed that most of them learned the lesson, though a few were excited to be exposed to this resource for the first time. To be sure, the latter kind of comment made me feel dirty, though I'm sure the students would have found Wikipedia sometime, at the very latest through Google searches, which is how I discovered it some years ago.</p>
<p>As much as I liked the Wikipedia experiment, I have decided not to repeat it this semester. For one thing, the process of helping 100 or more students find a suitable topic that has not already been done in Wikipedia is enormously time-consuming. So is teaching students how to use Wikipedia's relatively uncomplicated markup. Contrary to the stereotype about the youngest generation of university students being internet savvy, many of them only know how to use the internet in highly specific ways. (If you can read German, see Jan Hodel's comments on this issue <a href="http://weblog.histnet.ch/archives/896">here</a> and <a href="http://weblog.histnet.ch/archives/977">here</a>.) I did not have much time for technical details in class, so I had a lot of one-on-one student meetings in the computer lab. This circumstance does not mean that Wikipedia projects are not worth doing, but it is a significant factor to consider for the kind of large survey course that I have been teaching.</p>
<p>More to the point, however, the Wikipedia project and especially the group electronic scrapbook project I had students do revealed a more traditional weakness: too many students did not know how to do basic research using the library's catalog, reference desk, and databases. Indeed, they did not know how to use Google very well either. Furthermore, most students did not know how to evaluate the potential usefulness of books they found. They seem to have just assumed that a book was a book. The idea of examining the bibliography, for example, never occurred to many of them, even though I discussed the issue in the directions as well as in class. I thought that this kind of need was supposed to be filled in required English classes, but if that is happening, it is inadequate, because most of my students last semester were not freshman.</p>
<p>Hence, this semester I have decided to incorporate research skills into my course. A research paper is out of the question with so many students involved. Moreover, a research paper can become a distraction, since students are often most concerned simply with producing enough text. At the same time, I want to do something that gives students some choice, as most students really appreciated that aspect of the course last semester. Hence, I have decided to have students choose a research topic, develop a bibliography and write a short bibliographical essay to go with it. </p>
<p>I plan to devote some time to research issues in class and on a forum on Blackboard, to which George Mason recently switched from WebCT. Finally, I expect to talk to some students during office hours. Instead of giving technical lessons for Wikipedia markup, however, we will be able to talk research methods and history. Students also need to improve their electronic literacy, but I have to pick my battles.</p>
<p>Finally, some notes about plagiarism: An unusually high number of students thought they could get away with copying and pasting text for their online scrapbook projects. I instructed them about the university's honor system, but it seems much additional work is necessary in this area, should I ever do electronic assignments again. Interestingly, though, I did not find such copying in the Wikipedia projects. Perhaps students understood that others would be reading that work? Some students actually commented to me on how good it felt to do a homework assignment that they knew others would be reading. Be that as it may, it is possible that this semester's bibliography project will reduce plagiarism opportunities and temptations, since it will not be as readily available on the open market.</p>

			 <p>At the beginning of the week I suggested that Russia might have learned a lesson from the American invasion of Iraq.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> One lesson that Russia clearly did not learn was the importance of world opinion. The Bush administration paid a high price for thumbing its nose at allies and friends who opposed the invasion. It did not believe in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080503230522/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=7059">soft power</a>, but its significant diminution was real nonetheless. Russia’s actions will cost it dearly if it continues to allow its armored vehicles to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081209071041/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/16/world/europe/16armored.html">rumble around Georgia</a>, far away from South Ossetia. Remember that breakaway province? Wasn’t defending it Russia’s casus belli? Sometimes states have to ignore international opinion, but it is important to balance whatever one hopes thereby to gain against what one is going to lose. Russia has more to lose because of its pugnacious behavior than it thinks. It might believe that its interests lie in observing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081005230327/http://www.rightcommentary.com/2008/08/15/why-georgia-matters/">&ldquo;jail house yard&rdquo;</a> code of behavior, and following this model might net it some short-term gains; however, in the long run it will lose more than it can gain. Naked force is a poor substitute for hearts and minds. It is an even worse substitute if those hearts and minds stand behind an opposing force. Hubris is a dangerous thing, Mr. Putin. That’s the real lesson of Iraq.</p>

			 <p>Looking back, I am surprised at how easy it was for me to get through high school and many college courses without knowing a lot of basic vocabulary related to English grammar. I knew English grammar intuitively, and I could write, but I could not talk about grammar. I am lucky I knew enough intuitively, for this weakness could have become a real handicap for me in my studies.</p>
<p>In fact, it did become a weakness in one subject: Russian. We had to take a foreign language at Dartmouth College, and I fulfilled the requirement with Russian. But I was horrible. I do not believe that I ever rose above a C+. Part of the problem was study habits and discipline, but much of it related to my lack of appreciation of the nature of grammar. The professors used terms like genitive case, dative case, direct object, personal pronoun, possessive pronoun, conjugate, and decline, and it seemed like I had to devote too much energy to understanding that vocabulary and the things it indicated instead of learning Russian. Or I missed points entirely because I did not recognize their significance.</p>
<p>I only appreciated this dilemma later, after I took a break from Dartmouth and came back. During my time away I was in the army and stationed in Germany, where I learned to get by with rudimentary German. Upon returning to Dartmouth I decided I would like to learn German properly. My experience was enhanced considerably by a practical little book by Cecile Zorach entitled <em>English Grammar for Students of German</em>. It explained the way English grammar worked for certain situations and then compared it to German. It was through these comparisons that I began to gain an appreciation of the mechanics of English grammar and a vocabulary with which to talk about it. This knowledge later served me well when I found myself in Munich teaching English to Germans. Of course, the learning process never ended.</p>

			 <p>Sometimes history just leaps off the pages and proclaims its relevance for our own times. On December 24, 1894, <em>The Times</em> of London published a long editorial about the first trial of Captain Alfred Dreyfus for alleged treason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We must point out that, the more odious and unpopular a crime is, the more necessary is it that its proof and its punishment should be surrounded by all the safeguards of public justice. Of these, the most indispensable is publicity. . . . It may be important for the French people to preserve the secrets of their War Department, but it is of infinitely greater importance for them to guard their public justice against even the suspicion of unfairness or of subjection to the gusts of popular opinion."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Times</em> correspondent wrote these words when there was still little doubt of Dreyfus' guilt in the public at large. There were no Drefusards yet, that is, members of a movement to see the wrongfully convicted man exonerated. It was three years before <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2008/03/30/when_zola_wrote_jaccuse/">Emile Zola wrote "J'accuse."</a> The point wasn't about guilt or innocence. It was about the rule of law, which meant due process out in the open even for grave matters of national security. The later establishment of Dreyfus' innocence reminded observers why.</p>
<p>Tomorrow my class is discussing Michael Burns, <em>France and the Dreyfus Affair: A Documentary History</em> (Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 1999). Burns tells this dramatic tale with his own gripping prose interspersed with documents from the period. And he extends the tale as far as 1998, in order to help readers understand the affair's legacy. For those with more time on their hands I also recommend Jean Denis Bredin, <em>The Affair: The Case of Alfred Dreyfus</em>, trans. Jeffrey Mehlman (New York: George Braziller, 1986), a big history book that reads like a good political thriller.</p>

			 <p>Kevin Levin of <em>Civil War Memory</em> has posted good material to his academic blog under the category, <a href="http://cwmemory.com/book/black-confederate-resources/">myth of black Confederates</a>. Several recent posts include criticism of efforts by modern-day Confederate patriots and would-be historians who want to appropriate <a href="http://cwmemory.com/tag/weary-clyburn/">Weary Clyburn</a>, a slave, as a defender of Southern liberty. In one he points out that writing good books to debunk myths is all well and good, but on the subject of black Confederates "<a href="http://cwmemory.com/2008/07/16/weary-clyburn-and-black-confederates-where-do-we-go-from-here/">the real fight must take place on the web</a>."</p>
<p>In the same post he points to an earlier one he made in late March: "<a href="http://cwmemory.com/2008/03/28/should-civil-war-historians-blog-academic-that-is/">Should Civil War Historians Blog (academic that is)?</a>" In it he observes how vast the public discourse about the American Civil War is, while the discourse in which professional historians participate is relatively narrow. Historians need to continue their current research and publishing mission, but they also have "a responsibility to engage a wider audience and contribute to the public discourse." Since much of the public turns to the internet for ready answers, historians need to offer these answers in an accessible format, especially for highly sensitive questions that shape American identity.</p>
<p>I agree with Kevin about the need for Civil War historians to blog. I have also observed a similar need with respect to Holocaust denial, since I have found that <a href="http://markstoneman.com/2008/01/10/when-google-gets-it-wrong/">Google can get it wrong</a>. Until now I have used this blog mainly to reflect on what I do and to communicate with other historians, but as Kevin points out, Google brings him search engine traffic for important topics such as black Confederates, so his blog posts reach a wider audience. I have written a few of my posts with that awareness, but his arguments make me think I could do much more. So could other historians.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In a piece called "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/weekinreview/06weiner.html?ex=1373083200&en=f22743bc5560aeae&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">Mind Games: Remembering Brainwashing</a>" from today's <em>New York Times</em>, Tim Wiener points to one of the more irresponsible uses of historical documents that I have seen this summer. Apparently "American military and intelligence officers" (he is not more specific) decided in 2002 to examine Cold War CIA studies of Chinese interrogation methods during the Korean War. After all, these Communists were the supposed masters who fed the kinds of fears that later gave rise to a movie like "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manchurian_Candidate_%281962_film%29">The Manchurian Candidate</a>." In one major study the officers found examples of what are now often called "<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1322866">harsh interrogation techniques</a>" when the more negatively valued term "torture" is being deliberately avoided. "They reprinted a 1957 chart describing death threats, degradation, sleep deprivation—and worse—inflicted by Chinese captors. And they made it part of a new handbook for interrogators at Guantánamo."</p>
<p>The provenance of these techniques might give pause, but here's the real bombshell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The irony is that the original author of that chart, Albert D. Biderman, a social scientist who had distilled interviews with 235 Air Force P.O.W.’s, wrote that the Communists’ techniques mainly served to “extort false confessions.” And they were the same methods that “inquisitors had employed for centuries.” They had done nothing that “was not common practice to police and intelligence interrogators of other times and nations.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This story reminds me of the student who hurriedly pulls a bunch of quotes from a book without actually reading or studying the book as a whole, let alone thinking about its historical context. The student then slaps the material together in a paper that might confirm his own beliefs, but whose conclusions bear no tangible relationship to the source that he supposedly read and analyzed. Is that what happened here? Or was the document perhaps too complex for them? Perhaps they needed to invest in some historians who were not afraid to dig through this kind of thing in an honest manner, no matter what conclusions the documents might suggest.</p>

<p>Today citizens of the United States celebrate Independence Day. On this day, 232 years ago, thirteen American colonies proclaimed their independence from Great Britain in a famous document that Thomas Jefferson wrote, the Declaration of Independence. As a history teacher, I find this document fascinating, because it fuses together two different political traditions. On one hand, it recalls seventeenth-century English constitutionalism and its arguments about what had supposedly always been the rights of Englishmen. On the other hand, it advances the kind of powerful and universalizing claims about natural law and human rights spawned in the Enlightenment and given their most dramatic expression during the French Revolution. These connections make the document an interesting object lesson for the history classroom. They also can act as a healthy reminder to Americans that our Declaration of Independence displays not only differences from European political traditions, but also powerful affinities for them.</p>
<p>For traditions of English constitutionalism, have a look at the second half of the second paragraph of the <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/declare.asp">Declaration of Independence</a>, which speaks of "a long train of abuses and usurpations" and ends thus: "The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world." Following this statement is a list of all the King's offenses.</p>
<p>Now compare this list as well as the language complaining of tyranny to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/sourcebookofengl00leeg/page/348/mode/2up">Petition of Right</a>, which the English parliament issued in 1628 in response to perceived abuses of power by King Charles I, who a couple decades later fought a civil war and was eventually tried for treason and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040408013742/http://www3.baylor.edu/BIC/WCIII/Essays/charles.1.html">beheaded</a> in 1649. To understand the gulf in political culture between Parliament and the King, it is also helpful to look at a statement that the king's father, James I, wrote in 1598, while still just James VI of Scotland: <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/james1-trew2.html">True Law of Free Monarchies</a>. In it the king is a divine right ruler who sees himself as "before any estates or ranks of men within the same, before any Parliaments were holden or laws made; and by them was the land distributed (which at the first was wholly theirs), states erected and discerned, and forms of government devised and established."</p>
<p>England tried government without a monarchy for a about a decade, but in 1660 a Stuart, Charles II, once again ascended the throne. His son became King James II in 1688. Fears of the son's absolutist ambitions and attempts to bring Catholicism back to England led Parliament to depose him, and invite his daughter and son-in-law to rule, William and Mary. This time Parliament passed a much more far-reaching bill, the <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/england.asp">English Bill of Rights</a> of 1689, to which the new King and queen acquiesced. Nonetheless, Parliament did not claim to have the right to depose kings. Instead, it observed that James II had "abdicated the government and the throne [was] thereby vacant." After discussing his offenses, the members of the upper and lower houses of Parliament declared that "for the vindicating and asserting [of] their [the representatives'] ancient rights and liberties," kings could not rule without Parliament on their royal authority alone. The king was subject to the law. Then the document enumerates a series of rights that will look familiar to anyone who knows the first ten amendments of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.overview.html">United States Constitution</a>.</p>
<p>Jefferson's Declaration of Independence describes similar tyranny, and his explanation for the colonists' rebellion is not inconsistent with what Parliament had done eighty-eight years earlier. It represented not so much a revolution, per se, as a severing of relations with the king, in order to preserve traditional rights. Jefferson's own argument read thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the Declaration of Independence was consistent with English constitutionalist traditions, however, it also offered a powerful and universal statement about human beings that was based on natural law instead of ancient liberties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote >
<p>That all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of thinking was indeed revolutionary. In France beliefs in natural law soon helped bring down the old regime in 1789, though the American contribution to that was probably more the debts that Louis XVI had incurred in his support of the enemies of his enemy, Great Britain, during the American rebellion. Members of the Third Estate called the National Assembly into existence, and members of this body began their work by focusing on individual rights, only later turning to more practical constitutional issues. In contrast to England in 1688 and later the American colonies in 1776, though, the French didn't modify an existing form of government. They invented something new based on natural law. Read the <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/295/">Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen</a>, which appeared during the first summer of revolution. The first three items in this document will sound familiar to Americans who know their own country's foundational documents:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be based only on common utility.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2. The purpose of all political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3. The principle of all sovereignty rests essentially in the nation. No body and no individual may exercise authority which does not emanate expressly from the nation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The causal link between this document and our own Constitution and Declaration of Independence is indirect at best, but one can see the common concerns that had arisen from the Enlightenment, and the common justification for people coming together and forming a new political order of their own free will.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence has a foot in two different traditions, one of old English rights that Parliament asserted and expanded in the face of the absolutist ambitions of its kings, and one more universal, based on natural law and reflected not only in the ideals of the French Revolution, but also the 1948 <a href="https://archive.org/details/universaldeclara00unit">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>. It is tempting to speculate on how these two different traditions might continue to inform American political culture today, but that will have to wait for another time and perhaps another author. Important here is rather the conversation among foundational constitutional documents from the United States, England, and France.</p>

			 <p class="intro">This piece appeared on this day on the now defunct Blog Catalog's blog. At the time the site was a hybrid blog portal and social networking site with an active community.</p>
<!-- [web.archive.org/web/20080...](https://web.archive.org/web/20080528100342/http://blog.blogcatalog.com/guest-blogger/do-you-link-to-your-sources/) -->
<p>Too often I come across an interesting piece of information on a blog that does not contain links to the author’s sources. That’s too bad. All I can do at that point is shrug my shoulders and wonder if the story is true. Then I’ll probably close that browser tab and go somewhere else, because I won’t risk experiencing similar frustration with a second story on the same blog. Of course, if the story is really important to me, I can do further research on Google, which is fair enough. At the same time, though, what reason have you given me to go back to your blog? None. Offer me a good, well sourced post, though, and I will be back. Links to your sources are important for at least four reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verifiability. Links to your sources allow me to verify whether or not your story is true. For this to work, though, they should point to hard news sources, not just another blog. Bobbie Sullivan does this on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080603022243/http://aircrewbuzz.com/">Aircrew Buzz</a> and her other aviation blogs.</li>
<li>Acknowledgment. Sources permit you to acknowledge where you got your ideas and information from in the first place. These can include not only hard news sources, but also any blog or other source that sparked you to think about the topic. If the information is not generally known, though, include additional sources to satisfy the verifiability requirement. I sometimes handle acknowledgments with a hat tip. You can see one Gavin Robinson gave me in the first paragraph of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080527055920/http://www.investigations.4-lom.com/2008/05/15/14th-military-history-carnival/">14th Military History Carnival</a>.</li>
<li>Examples. Sources can help provide you with the kinds of examples you need to support your arguments. Since the internet is a hypertext environment, sources can also help you to pack more information into a post without providing loads of background details. I used links in this manner in the second paragraph of a post about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080616052306/http://markstoneman.wordpress.com/2008/04/29/barack-obama-jeremiah-wright-and-generational-differences/">generational differences</a> between Barack Obama and Jeremiah Wright. I’m also linking examples in this post about sources.</li>
<li>Context. Sources help locate your ideas within their broader context. By providing links to that context, you help your reader to understand how your ideas relate to other opinions and discussions on the internet, and on your own blog. In the process you provide additional value to your reader, giving her one more reason to return. One blogger who often provides good context through linked sources is Rich Becker of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080522050927/http://copywriteink.blogspot.com/">Copywrite. Ink.</a></li>

<p>Of course, not all blog posts need sources. If you are writing about your own life, you are the acknowledged expert on it. Enough said. And no one who has heard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080605125917/http://www.blogcatalog.com/discuss/entry/chill-sort-of-song-red-panda-recording">Tony Hogan’s music</a> is going to ask him to provide sources for the advice he offers on learning the guitar. It helps, though, that he has a good <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080331121251/http://acousticguitarist.wordpress.com/about/">about page</a> on his blog, which tells us a bit more about him. And what about me? Why do I think I can offer this advice without providing sources on the art of sourcing? My field is history, and getting students to understand the value of sources is one of my everyday teaching concerns.

Chamberlain isn't criticized in history for talking to Hitler, but rather for giving away the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia and with it that country's means to defend itself against Germany. The difference is not trivial. And what does McCain's echoing of Bush's remarks tell us about him? Did he also not learn this bit of history? Or is this just politics?

			 <p>I have been teaching History 100, the one-semester survey of Western Civilization that is required for all students at <a href="http://www.gmu.edu">George Mason University</a>. Yes, really. One semester. As I mentioned earlier, this semester I decided to abandon the old chronological approach and follow a thematic one instead. I organized the course into six major themes, plus an introductory unit on historical thinking. One of those themes was "Politics and Human Rights."</p>
<p>If one looks at Western Civ textbooks or the reading lists from my days as a graduate student, human rights are not going to be an obvious subject of study, especially not for a history survey that can only afford to choose six major topics. Yet they are not only important to learn about, they also offer a powerful integrative vehicle for talking about a variety of issues that have been central to the history of the West since the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>I took my cue from a nice little collection of primary sources that Lynn Hunt edited and translated: <em>The French Revolution and Human Rights: A Brief Documentary History</em> (Boston and New York: Bedford/St. Martin's, 1996). Of course, people did not use the term "human rights" in the eighteenth century, but they did reimagine and rework the relationship between the individual and the state in a fundamental way. The rights that eighteenth-century thinkers and politicians posited and then fought for formed the basis of what we now consider fundamental human rights: freedom of religion and expression, the protection of one's property, and the right to pursue an occupation and earn rewards according to one's talents, not birth. Government existed to protect these and other rights, not according to the whims of a monarch above the law.</p>
<p>The English gained such rights based on the accumulation of precedents over time. Milestones included the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/magna-carta">Magna Carta</a> (1215) and the <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/england.asp">English Bill of Rights</a> (1689). Rights grew more expansive, but they adhered to Englishmen as Englishmen. Enlightenment thought, on the other hand, was characterized by its universality. Men had rights by virtue of their common humanity. Thomas Jefferson reflected both traditions in the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration.html">Declaration of Independence</a> (1776), which enumerated English offenses against the colonists' rights, on one hand, but contained language whose bold universality conveyed a message far beyond its original purpose:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we know from American history, this famous declaration left many questions unanswered and long went unrealized in society. Who was to be included in this equality? At first it was only all free men. Black slaves were property. There was also the question of property qualifications for voting rights. Could the poor and uneducated be trusted to make the right decisions in a democracy? And what about women? Much of American history can be told as the history of making Jefferson's words become a reality.</p>
<p>These questions also held great urgency during the <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/">French Revolution</a>, which offers unparalleled opportunities for students to read about, reflect on, and discuss the major issues thrown up by the advent of citizenship and individual rights. For instead of struggling with the major issues over a period of some two centuries, the revolutionaries in France tried to do it all in a period of only five years, from the onset of the Revolution in 1789 to the end of the Terror in 1794.</p>
<p>The most enduring document from that time was <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/rightsof.asp">The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen</a> (1789), but students can also consider Olympes de Gouges' <a href="https://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/293/">Declaration of the Rights of Woman</a> (1791). Besides these and some other famous documents, Hunt's book contains a host of compelling material otherwise unavailable in English. The main point of the exercise is to help students think about where our notions of such rights come from and to understand better their contingent and contested nature in the past.</p>
<p>Discussing Hunt's book covered one seventy-five minute unit. Two more units entailed a lecture that walked students through these issues in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, along the way exploring the issues of nationalism, feminism, socialism, and totalitarianism. I am still not satisfied with the result, but the topic of human rights lent Europe's confusing political history more narrative coherence than I had been able to muster in the past. It also permitted me to push the issue into the second half of the twentieth century and include the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (1948), decolonization, the <a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy-protest/helsinki_2716.jsp">Helsinki Accords</a> (1975), the collapse of Europe's communist regimes, and the human rights abuses that followed Yugoslavia's breakup.</p>
<p>My mind was dizzy after such a trip, especially since I use slides but no prepared text. I'm sure some students had trouble with the shifting geography and rapidly advancing timeline. Nonetheless, they were able to follow one theme over the course of two hundred years and see how it touches on nearly every major aspect of history in this time. How many other topics link politics, the economy, gender, race, religion, ideology, party politics, war, and international relations in such clearly important ways? In future I will surely make changes in how I cover the topic, but I will continue to give it an important place in my survey courses.</p>

			 <p class="intro">This post originally appeared on Language for You (now closed) on this date.</p>
<p>Learning English is not just about sentence structure, grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and intonation. There is also the problem of culture. People talk about different things in different countries, and when they discuss these things, they might use blunt language, euphemistic language, or something in-between. The choice might be personal, but often it is cultural.</p>
<p>One cultural peculiarity of Americans is small talk. For instance, I have no trouble chatting with total strangers while waiting in a grocery store line or for a bus. When I try that in southern Germany, however, people look at me like I am very strange indeed, or so the reactions have seemed to me.</p>
<p>Culture also affects how we talk about ourselves at job interviews, which is the real point of this short post. You see, NPR recently did a story on the challenges non-native speakers encounter in the United States when hunting for a job. Check out Sally Herships, "<a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103980228">Overcoming Cultural Barriers To Jobs</a>."</p>
<p>What do you think? Have you got any cross-cultural stories to share?</p>

			 <p>The Washington, DC International <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080509121956/http://www.filmfestdc.org/">Film Festival</a> has been around for twenty-two years now, but this is the first time I’ve actually attended. Usually I’m too swamped by end-of-the-semester grading. This was true of this year too, but my wife wasn’t accepting that excuse, and I’m glad. We managed to see four films this week: “Egg” [Yumurta] (Semih Kaplanoglu, Turkey/Greece, 2007), “Tricks” [Sztuczki] (Andrzej Jakimowski, Poland, 2007), “The Edge of Heaven” [Auf der anderen Seite] (Fatih Akin, Germany/Turkey, 2007), and “With Your Permission” [Til Doden os Skiller] (Paprika Steen, Sweden/Denmark, 2007).</p>
<p>Our favorite movies were “Egg” and “Tricks,” both of which contained not only humor, but a certain magical quality, where time and stress were suspended. As much happened in the people’s faces and as in their words. In “Egg” the looks passed between a man who returned to his hometown to bury his mother and the young woman who had taken care of his mother. In “Tricks” the looks passed between a young boy and his teenage sister, as well as between the boy and the man he was sure was his father. There was also a lot of movement in “Tricks” as the boy explored and played around the train station and town, though most of these actions were part of everyday life, not a dramatic sequence of events. I enjoyed getting lost in the worlds these two films offered.</p>
<p>We wanted to see “The Edge of Heaven”, because we had enjoyed an extremely funny movie by the same directory called “Kebab Connection.” We knew this movie wasn’t going to be funny, but I was surprised by the unpleasant turns of fate mixed with occasional joy and life’s refusal to stop moving on. It could have been an excellent, if sometimes confusing movie, had not the distributors sent the film to the theater with the reels in the wrong order. Instead of seeing the movie’s three parts in the correct order, we saw the middle, then the beginning, then the end. If it had to happen, I suppose this was the movie where it would do the least damage, but it was still disappointing. As it was, I got the story and simple slices of life from Germany and Turkey, but much of the overarching story was lost on me. Afterwards I ended up focusing my attention not on the message, but on trying to re-imagine the film in the correct order. Still not there yet.</p>
<p>“With Your Permission” is a worthwhile dark comedy with an operatic emotional high point. I’m glad I saw it, but it was not in the same league with the first two magical films I saw. Nor was it intended to be, I think. It begins with a man who has a black eye from his wife. She beats him more than once and he acts increasingly strange. His boss on the ferry makes him seek help. Unusual twists in the plot with some hilarious characters follow on the way to an emotionally satisfying result.</p>
<p>I would also like to mention one of the many films we wanted to see but couldn’t. We had time to see “Jazz in the Diamond District” (Lindsey Christian, USA, 2007), but it was sold out and shown only once. Oh well. I hope it gets more play here in DC. It’s not in the same league as the other films I saw this week, but it is about real people who live in my city, not the politicians.

			 <p>Times might have changed, but it seems that some didn’t get the memo. It would be nice if Reverend Jeremiah Wright would trust the next generation, embodied by Senator Barack Obama, to do things its way, instead of clinging to his own experiences and ignoring the great changes that this society has undergone. Why is he trying so hard to wreck the Obama campaign anyway? Maybe he doesn’t believe a black man can get elected and now he is in the business of creating a self-fulfilling prophesy? I dunno.</p>
<p>What I do know is that someone else from his earlier generation is also out of touch with what leaders like Obama are saying.</p>
<p>Listen to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080430174356/http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/04252008/profile.html">Bill Moyer’s interview with Wright</a>, and you will see Moyers feeling very much at ease with the man. Moyers (born in 1934) is a little older than Wright (born in 1941), but both experienced the Johnson administration and the Civil Rights Movement as young men. I respect their experiences and enjoy hearing their thoughts on where America is at. I also enjoyed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080505040723/http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/03282008/profile.html">Moyer’s conversation with Fred Harris</a> (born in 1930), the only surviving member of the Kerner Commission, which reported on the racism underlying the social inequality that had helped set off the race riots after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968. The thing about Moyers’ and Harris’ conversation that stood out most for me, however, was that it appeared on the show right after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080505040723/http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/03282008/profile2.html">Moyer’s conversation with Mayer Cory Booker</a> of Newark. Booker (born in 1969) did not speak the language of race and anger. Like Obama (born in 1961), he is very much about members of the community doing what they can to move forward. Watch the video and you’ll understand what I mean. (You’ll also maybe want to see him on the national stage at some point.) Watch too how Moyers is almost mystified by Booker’s perspective, one Obama shares. Moyers expects to see righteous anger in Booker. He wants Booker to blame all of Newark’s woes on racism and demand assistance from the federal government, but Booker refuses to follow that path. This conversation made clear to me that a vast gulf separates my generation (I am forty-five) from Moyers’. It also made me glad that leaders such as Obama and Booker are out there.</p>
<p>Obama understands the differences between the experiences of his generation and those of Wright’s. Wright might too, but he seems unwilling to trust the next generation to do the right thing. Instead he is out there doing what he seems to feel is truth-telling, that is, trying to wreck the very real chances that a former member of his congregation has to become the next president. Yet if he has done his job as the pastor of his congregation, he can trust those he helped bring up in his church to do the right thing. Time to let go, Reverend Wright, and give Senator Obama a chance to do it his way.</p>
<p>Yet Wright seems trapped in the experiences of his own generation. He seems unable to acknowledge that Obama’s generation has undergone a different set of experiences. He also thinks in unhistorical terms. As a historian I grew dizzy listening to him jump back and forth across the centuries and millennia, as if injustices here and there were all part of the same unchanging story. Thus I cringed when he called himself a historian of religion at one point in his conversation with Moyers. He knows more than I ever will about the subject, but he was not <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2008/03/14/fostering-historical-thinking.html">thinking historically</a>. He could not move across different times and imagine that each period involved different mentalities and experiences. For him it was all one story with one set of values. Thus, he seems to differ from Obama not just in generational terms, but also in terms of the philosophy of history that underlies his worldview. Obama’s major speech on race was keenly aware of the passage of time and its impact on people living in it. Wright, on the other hand, is almost oblivious to it—unless he is just getting carried away by his own intemperate and impolitic rBarack Obama, Jeremiah Wright, and Generational Differences</p>

Obama’s major speech on race was keenly aware of the passage of time and its impact on people living in it. Wright, on the other hand, is almost oblivious to it—unless he is just getting carried away by his own intemperate and impolitic rhetoric.hetoric.</p>

			 <p>Last October, in connection with the bad news about Blackwater coming out, I made the following remarks on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080503005936/http://clioandme.wordpress.com/2007/10/08/outsourcing-military-tasks/">Clio and Me</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of President Bush’s mistakes was to go to war with only enough public support to begin it. There is no such thing as war on the cheap. Private contractors are expensive in mere dollars, but they have helped the administration to avoid seeking a more solid domestic political foundation for the war—or accepting the consequences if it is unable to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I stand by those remarks, but a piece in Sunday’s <em>New York Times</em> points to more sophisticated Pentagon management of the media than I had believed possible. In &ldquo;Behind Analysts, the Pentagon’s Hidden Hand,&rdquo; <a href="https://archive.ph/rFAz5">David Barstow reports</a> on the Pentagon’s active courtship of so-called independent military analysts on the major television news networks. The analysts were seduced not only by the flattering attention by the Pentagon and the fees paid by the media, but also by the financial opportunities that their access to the Pentagon provided because of their ties to companies seeking military contracts.</p>
<p>On my tumblelog I was only half-joking when earlier this evening I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One more reason to watch The News Hour on PBS instead. So what is this now? The military-industrial-media complex? Or is everything okay since this has been stage-managed by our duly elected president’s appointed cronies?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, propaganda or “psyops” [psychological operations] will only get the administration and Pentagon so far.</p>

			 <p>I heard a report on <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/">Marketplace</a> this evening about the high cost of textbooks and how Congress wants to force publishers to reveal to professors the costs of books they require in their courses. I find it strange that such a measure should be necessary. Is it that hard to figure out what books cost? I use Amazon when writing a syllabus. So do many other cost-conscious professors. And who is this professor they quoted who talked about being courted by publishing representatives with good chocolate in the mailroom and meals out? Certainly no history professor.</p>
<p>The report blamed the rapidly growing cost of textbooks on an expansion of the used book market because of the internet. Really? Used books sounds right, but to my mind this isn't the internet per se, but rather the chains that sell books in so many university book stores. I don't know what kind of arrangement they have with their host universities, but I wouldn't be surprised if these universities are complicit in the process, insofar as they are earning money from these arrangements.</p>
<p>Returning to the original topic, it is sometimes hard to tell how much new books will cost students, because publishers can only qoute net prices. In the past I tried to bundle books from a publisher, in order to lower costs. Result: the net price to the bookstore went down, but the bookstore priced the bundle with no discount, because it had to make these books more expensive than the used books it wanted to sell at some two thirds to three quarters of the new price. It earns a higher margin on those, after all.</p>
<p>Some students at Georgetown University have the right idea. They set up a book coop that collects books at the end of the semester and sells books at the beginning of the next semester at the prices the owners of the books set. I wish George Mason University had something like that. I've tried to help by setting up a Google group on which my students can establish contact with each other for the purpose of buying and selling their books. So far I've had no takers.</p>

			 <p>We get most of our fruit and vegetables through a local cooperative called a CSA, which stands for Community Supported Agriculture. Unlike a typical buying cooperative though, a CSA also works to support the producers of food, often one farmer. It binds producers and consumers together, so that producers know they have a certain income, and consumers get more or less food, depending on how things are going.</p>
<p>The one to which my wife and I belong is called Spiritual Food CSA. It supports biodynamic farming, which practices more stringent standards than regular organic farming, though I don’t know all the details. The word spiritual comes in, because the CSA is organized by a local yoga ashram, for whom healthy food, a healthy earth, healthy people, and a healthy spiritual life are inseparable. At least that’s what I think it means. I don’t get into the spiritual side of things, but I like taking yoga, and the people at the Shanti Yoga Ashram are just plain good folk. If only I had time for yoga right now. My commute from Northwest DC to Fairfax, VA and my teaching schedule has been keeping me away. Must change that.</p>
<p>Anyway, we pay one price for half a year and then pick up a share of food every week. Apples from the fall harvest had been accumulating in my fridge, as had oranges, which the CSA gets direct from Florida. Today, I decided to take action. I dug out the old juice maker and made orange juice and apple juice. I also made a large glass of apple sauce. Yum!</p>

			 <p>Spring is almost here, which means its time to order books for the summer term. Summer in DC gets hot, and the summer terms are short, so I usually try to assign things that are both reasonably entertaining and not too long for the general audience I get in my introductory survey courses that are mandatory requirements for all majors. Besides covering a variety of themes and genres, I often try to pick one book that will jump-start historical thinking. I want a book that will make students more aware of how much <a href="http://hnn.us/articles/42835.html" title="Is America a Christian Nation? What Both Left and Right Get Wrong
by John Fea">"the past is like a foreign country"</a> that we will not understand, if we do not try to fathom the conditions and assumptions of the time without letting our contemporary worldview get in our way.</p>
<p>Last year I tried Bertolt Brecht's <em>Galileo</em>, which I had first experienced as a TA for Sandra Horvath-Peterson at Georgetown University back in the 1990s. Of course, Brecht adapts Galileo's story to his own purposes, but it provides a useful point of departure for a discussion about the Scientific Revolution. It also forces students to come to terms with the limits of historical fiction.</p>
<p>It usually goes pretty well, though the first section I did it in was a little rocky, partly because not enough students had done the reading, but also because I was surprised that so few people had any general knowledge of fascism. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802130593/">paperback edition</a> we used, translated by Eric Bently, contains some excellent material on Brecht's prejudices, but it spends too much time on material more of interest to specialists in drama. Some students read the first part of it, but most gave up and went straight to the play. So I integrated a mini talk of Brecht's time into the discussions and got them to reason out how the problems of the nineteen thirties and forties had manifested themselves in a play Brecht had set in the seventeenth century. I also assigned sources from <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/galileo-tuscany.html" title="Galileo Galilei: Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina of Tuscany, 1615">1615</a> and <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1630galileo.html" title="The Crime of Galileo: Indictment and Abjuration of 1633">1633</a>, so that they could get a sense of the issues from Galileo's own time.</p>
<p>One point I tried to make clear was that science was only then beginning to manifest itself as an independent discourse, that it was perfectly natural for the Church to be interested in science at the time and even claim authority on the matter. Of course, I'm no specialist on the matter, but it seems to me that this basic point is worth making. Most students seemed to get it too. Indeed, I felt like cheering when one woman near the end of a class wondered aloud what people would think about our own world in another few hundred years. Sound trivial? Maybe to historians and those for whom historical thinking comes naturally. In our presentist society and with this <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2007/07/21/across-generations/">presentist generation</a>, I think the question was excellent. This student and her classmates were thinking historically.</p>
<p>The success of this discussion was also due in part to another issue. I have begun to &ldquo;legitimate confusion&rdquo; for my students,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that is, I have begun to cultivate an awareness in them of just how hard historical interpretation can be and how important learning how to ask questions can be. With this attitude, students can explore sources and ideas honestly and thoughtfully without fear of getting it wrong and looking bad. With such an awareness, students were willing to attempt the leaps of imagination necessary to navigate among three different time periods, the early twenty-first century, the nineteen thirties and forties, and the first few decades of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>I might try this book again, though I could also do with a change. Perhaps some of you have some ideas?</p>

			 <p>It's spring break at <a href="http://www.gmu.edu">George Mason University</a> (GMU), and, starting tomorrow, I will have the apartment to myself during the day. Of course, there is a mountain of student work to correct and classes to prepare, but I think I will be able to resume blogging here again. For starters, I do not have to spend three hours a day in busses and trains between Northwest DC and Fairfax, VA. Excuses aside, I sure do admire those of you who are able to teach and blog at the same time, and I hope to begin doing the same again myself. And, hey, I even have a TA this semester, though I don't really have an office, unless having a place available for office hours that three other people use counts.</p>
<p>I'm teaching three sections of History 100 again, that is, GMU's one-semester survey in Western Civilization. I'm doing it differently <a href="http://historysurvey.blogspot.com/2007/12/getting-ready-for-spring-2008-hist-100.html">this semester</a> than in previous semesters. I've thrown out the chronological approach in favor of a thematic one. I would have done this earlier, but I never got around to planning it out. This time I did not let a minor detail like that get in my way. Better to name six major themes ahead of time and then work my way through them during the semester. The chronological alternative was simply too frustrating for both me and my students.</p>
<p>I've also dispensed with traditional exams and writing assignments. Instead they are each doing a Wikipedia project, an idea I got from <a href="http://edwired.org/?p=245">Mills Kelly</a>. They are also doing a group research project (three to four students each) that will result in electronic output, whether a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dnL00TdmLY">wiki</a>, a blog, an old-fashioned website, or something on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRqUE6IHTEA">GoogleDocs</a>. Traditional writing and research skills still matter, but I thought I would give them assignments that teach other skills as well.</p>
<p>One thing I've learned in the process already: I have to spend a lot of one-on-one time with individual students who are less familiar with this media. But they're catching on, and the course wiki I set up with Wikispaces is working well. Each page has a place for threaded discussions, and the students are talking. I'd like to think it was for the love of the subject, which in some cases it is. I am also basing a substantial chunk of their grades for the course on online and class participation.</p>
<p>I do not think my thematic approach will have implications for my summer session at Georgetown University, where the mandatory survey, Themes in European Civilization, lasts two semesters. Also, because each course meets daily for five weeks in the summer, there will be no need for a wiki and there will be less opportunity for a long-term project. I'll probably work with the old format of exams and short papers, but I want to give that a little more thought.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’ve started reading Thomas Pynchon’s, <em>Against the Day</em>. I enjoy Pynchon, though there’s no guarantee I’ll be able to say anything meaningful about his novel because his narratives are often difficult to follow. Take, for instance, the cryptic but thought-provoking quote from Thelonius Monk at the beginning of the book: “It’s always night, or we wouldn’t need light.”</p>
<p>This novel is set at the turn of the previous century, beginning with the Columbian World’s Fair in 1893 and running past the First World War. As usual, Pynchon sometimes seems to play fast and loose with historical facts, so it doesn’t feel like historical fiction in any traditional sense. That’s not a criticism, mind you, just something to keep in mind when reading it.</p>
<p>Maybe I will have to make use of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418021935/http://pynchonwiki.com/">Thomas Pynchon Wiki</a>, which I just discovered. And maybe, just maybe, I’ll check out some of the many reviews on the novel, though I don’t want to spoil it for myself, especially since I find my tastes are often out of sync with those of the reviewers.</p>
<p>One practical thing I like: with 1085 pages, this $18.00 paperback is a relative bargain; it’s going to keep me busy for a long time.</p>
<p>Perhaps after that I’ll go back and look at some of his earlier stuff. I read <em>Vineland</em> when it came out in paperback, but I hadn’t touched Pynchon before that since I was maybe only twenty-one. I read <em>Gravity’s Rainbow</em>, for instance, while in the field artillery on maneuver in Grafenwöhr, Germany. I still remember clinging to the book while bouncing up and down and eating dust on dirt roads on the back of a self-propelled eight-inch howitzer.</p>

			 <p>In his 1998 survey of human history, <em>The Way of the World</em>, David Fromkin writes of Prohibition in the United States thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The experiment proved to be a disaster. Human nature resisted it. The inability of the government to enforce the laws against alcohol brought about a general collapse of law and order in such cities as Chicago in the 1920s. In the 1930s the law and the constitutional amendment were repealed, and order was restored. (215)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This observation reminds me of both drug policy and immigration policy in the United States. We legislate social change and then are surprised when it doesn’t occur or law and order come under threat. Fromkin is on to something when he writes, “Prohibition was an extreme symptom of a general American view that anything can be changed by passing a law, a view that ignores rooted realities of human nature” (215). This idealism is also evident in our foreign policy.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, we used to criticize the Soviet Union for its utopian attempt to remake human nature as it strove to realize the Communist dreams of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. While it took some American idealism to overcome the Soviet threat, it also took hard-nosed realism. Where would we be now if we had decided to turn the Cold War into a shooting war in the name of an idea called democracy?</p>

			 <p>My wife has had a handful of volumes from Alexander McCall Smith’s wonderful private detective series set in Botswana. I had long wanted to get going on them, but she had loaned out the first volume and we don’t know who has it. Last week I was pleased to find a copy of the first volume in our laundry room, where people in my building sometimes deposit unwanted books. I am so glad I began reading it. I was hoping for detective stories with a harder edge, but that didn’t happen. Instead I got something better. The main character, Mma Precious Ramotswe, “a traditionally built woman,” is the most likeable character I’ve encountered in years. She’s a real woman with real problems, but with rare strength and courage, as well as a fine zest for life. This sounds like a cliche, but I am loathe to go into details for fear of spoiling plots. You can find out more on the author’s website, if you want.</p>
<p>I am almost done with the fourth. Now I have to take a break again, because we’re missing the fifth and sixth, and I don’t want to go straight to the seventh, which we have. Apparently there’s an eighth out now too.</p>
<p>By the way, I enjoy reading mysteries not just for the mystery, but for the milieu they usually reveal to me. Indeed, these books would have been a disappointment if mystery was all I had wanted. The stories are all about the characters and their world in Botswana. Along the way Mma Ramotswe and her assistant, Mma Makutsi, deal with a variety of cases and moral questions.</p>

I say <em>finally</em>, because those discussions have made the place more than a little unpleasant at times over the past year. People are still free to take advantage of BlogCatalog’s group feature, however, and talk about whatever they want there.</p>
<p>I believe that life online is akin to life in the physical world, and that the rules of civil discourse that I learned before the internet existed should still apply. To me this includes the stricture in everyday life on talking about religion in groups where there are a variety of sensibilities but little or no common purpose. No good can come from such a group slugging it out over whether God exists or not, what Christianity really means, and so on—not in a public space where anyone can join in.</p>
<p>My students have been able to talk about religion and society on a wiki I set up for my Western Civilization course this semester, but that’s different. There the students have a common purpose, and I’ve only needed to remind them of it a couple times.</p>

			 <p>Hillary Clinton likes to talk about her years of experience and how she will be ready for office from day one, should she win the Democratic nomination and then make it all the way to the White House. If she wins the nomination, I’ll vote for her, but I’m not buying the argument that Obama has not demonstrated some good leadership skills. Take, for instance, his and Clinton’s respective presidential campaigns, which are non-trivial operations. Obama emerged from Super Tuesday in a dead heat with Clinton and then managed to bring about an impressive string of consecutive wins. Clinton, by contrast, has slipped. In Friday’s Christian Science Monitor, Linda Feldmann <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080310222244/http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0222/p01s05-uspo.html">writes</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What happened? On Clinton’s part, her straits represent a massive failure of planning and organization, analysts say. Her campaign operated on the assumption she would have the nomination effectively locked up with the 22 contests on Feb. 5, and it spent accordingly. The lack of a Plan B has left her scrambling for cash and organizing late in the post-Super Tuesday contests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This situation says something significant about Clinton’s and Obama’s respective leadership skills. Now if only Michelle Obama would stop saying that her husband is the first reason she ever had to be proud of her country.</p>

			 <p>My son, who is in the eleventh grade, has long supported Senator Obama, but now he is even making phone calls on behalf of the Obama campaign. It does my heart good to see youth get excited and even hopeful about politics in this way. Sure, my son didn’t grow up on Watergate and defeat in Vietnam, as I did, but his generation was exposed to other things that could be expected to cause cynicism, namely the scandals surrounding Clinton’s sex life and Congress’s ridiculous decision to impeach him. The way that Bush came to the White House the first time or the U.S. started the war in Iraq could also be expected to make youth feel cynical and powerless. Instead though, there are people like my son who have decided that cynicism has no place in their lives or this country’s political future. Good for them.</p>

			 <p>Teaching undergraduate students forces me to deliver narratives and explanations to people who do not share my professional assumptions about how the world works and the way history should be told. It challenges me to think about how I can retell old stories with a different vocabulary. In the process I might even learn something. This is especially likely to happen when students ask me questions or express strong feelings about a major event. I last noticed this phenomenon in the fall, when I had my students visit the Holocaust Museum and discuss their experience in the course's online forum. I got to thinking about it again today because of an article about innovation in the New York Times last month. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/business/30know.html?ex=1356843600&en=5d04acf0f946a3a9&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">Innovative Minds Don't Think Alike</a>, by Janet Rae-Dupree, points to the benefits that can accrue to experts when they open themselves up to the perspectives of outsiders.</p>
<p>Rae-Dupree's article suggests to me other possible sources of historiographical innovation. What if we spent more time talking to historians doing research outside of our narrow areas of expertise? Such conversations should occur not only among historians with different regional specializations, but also among historians who study quite different things.</p>
<p>This understanding of innovation also points to the intellectual bankruptcy of arguments some historians offer in condemnation of their colleagues' use of theoretical work from other disciplines. Drawing on the work of scholars in other fields can be highly productive. As a graduate student, I found the theoretical and empirical work of French sociologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu">Pierre Bourdieu</a> both stimulating and productive. I used it in my research, if not in my narratives, but I always used to wonder if historians' eclectic use of such work might lead to some rather unorthodox results that the original sociologist might reject. Nowadays I do not think any such rejection would bother me or undermine the value of the work I did. Maybe it takes an outsider to spark innovation in history, and maybe it also takes a historian to see a new way to use an outsider's ideas.</p>
<p>This line of thought presupposes that innovation in history is a good thing, provided that it is true to the sources. Those who subscribe to the notion that history is only a recreation of the past as it actually was will probably object. I suspect, though, that while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranke">Leopold von Ranke's</a> view of history informs the working ethos of most of us historians, most of us are also more skeptical&mdash;and modest&mdash;about our ability to recreate such a past, especially in view of our rapidly changing present, which affects how we see the past.</p>

			 <p>We were out of bread, and my wife asked me if I would bake some. It had been a while, so I said yes. Now three small loaves of whole-grain wheat bread are rising on a cookie sheet with a clean thin cotton towel over them. They look beautiful too. If only I had a camera! Of course, then I’d also have to know how to use it. Food photography, I suspect, is not easy.</p>
<p>The bread contains whole-grain wheat flour, yeast, water, barley syrup, oil, and salt. Simple, healthy ingredients. Also good was all the kneading. There’s something satisfying about that. The bread tastes twice as good when I make it myself, maybe because it is part of a more authentic experience than going to the store represents.</p>
<p>One thing I would do, if I had my druthers, would be to grind the flour fresh from wheat berries. But we don’t have a mill like we used to when we were living in Augsburg, Germany back in the early 1990s. Also, wheat berries are expensive and not available here in DC in large quantities. In Augsburg my wife drove with a friend out to a farmer to buy sacks of grain—wheat, spelt, rye, barley, millet, and Grünkern (spelt harvested while only half ripe and then roasted). We ground the grain as we needed it with a little electric mill. We milled fine flour for baking or course stuff for cooking entrees of various kinds.</p>
<p>Now the bread’s in the oven.</p>
<p>Baking bread requires several periods of waiting. First I had to wait for the water and yeast mixture to bubble. During that time I made supper. Then I had to wait for the dough I made rise. During that time I made some whole grain ginger cookies. Then I punched down the dough, made the loaves and had to let them rise. Washed dishes, listened to the news, and began some blogging. Forty-five more minutes till nirvana.</p>
<p>I used to bake a great deal more, and then I went years without doing it. I started again last winter, but the heat in the summer put me off it. Well, winter’s here again, so a hot kitchen feels good.</p>

Engst of Tidbits <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080312091319/http://db.tidbits.com/article/9360">reports</a> that Google is talking about creating an alternative to Wikipedia in which each page or “knol” is controlled by one author. The idea is to give Google a chance at reaching the first spot in its own search results so it can serve ads on that page. Like Engst, I’m unimpressed.</p>
<p>Knol is an interesting example of the tension in Google between its primary mission as a search engine and its competing goal to provide platforms for generating ad revenue. While this new project does not mean Google has turned to content creation itself, I wonder how neutral it will be when it comes time to serve links in its search results. It has been neutral with pages served by two of its other children, Blogger and Google Page Creator. Let’s hope that trend continues.</p>

			 <h3 id="producing-knowledge">Producing Knowledge</h3>
<p>Mills Kelly of <a href="http://edwired.org/?p=254">Edwired</a> responds to the notion that the historical profession is about writing and therefore about publishing in traditional academic print media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that the essence of scholarship is the circulation of knowledge and the discussion of that knowledge among both peers and other interested parties. How is knowledge circulated? Print, the Internet, a museum exhibit, film, radio, are all methods for circulating knowledge and all of them require some sort of writing–even if that writing doesn’t result in yet another monograph or journal article. Just as one example–this blog had more than 75,000 unique visitors in 2007. If I’m lucky, my book will sell 1,000 copies. So how is more knowledge circulated?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="teaching-survey-courses">Teaching Survey Courses</h3>
<p>In <a href="http://www.historians.org/teaching-and-learning/classroom-content/the-aha-guide-to-teaching-and-learning-with-new-media">The AHA Guide to Teaching and Learning with New Media</a>, John McClymer makes an interesting point about one major difficulty of teaching introductory history classes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I routinely begin our explorations of topics by asking students to come up with questions. There are several reasons. The most important is that it legitimates confusion. All learning begins in puzzlement, but teachers and students routinely connive in the illusion that students understand the causes of the French Revolution and any number of equally complex developments. The first and second year students in my “Modern Europe and U.S.,1815 to the Present” do not. This is not a failure on their part or mine. A good undergraduate math student can learn to integrate equations in a Calculus I course. An equally good history student cannot master the causes of the French Revolution in an introductory history course.</p>

			 <p>James Kirchick published a piece called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080312091301/http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=e2f15397-a3c7-4720-ac15-4532a7da84ca">Angry White Man</a> in <em>The New Republic</em> on January 8th. Kirchick waded through some three decades' worth of Ron Paul&rsquo;s newsletters, which he quotes extensively. I do not want to repeat the inflammatory racist and paranoid language he found, but Kirchick&rsquo;s summary of the newsletters' source value bears repeating.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What they reveal are decades worth of obsession with conspiracies, sympathy for the right-wing militia movement, and deeply held bigotry against blacks, Jews, and gays. In short, they suggest that Ron Paul is not the plain-speaking antiwar activist his supporters believe they are backing&ndash;but rather a member in good standing of some of the oldest and ugliest traditions in American politics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Normally I would just ignore a right-wing crank like Paul, but he&rsquo;s been gaining too much respectable attention lately. I&rsquo;ve also seen well-meaning opponents of the Iraq War support him who would be horrified by his decades-long history of racism and fear-mongering. The more blog posts about this subject the better.</p>
<p>Maybe the mainstream media will finally pick up on it for the presidential debates. Who knows? Maybe Ron Paul&rsquo;s fellow Republicans will show some backbone and call him out on this too. Or are they afraid of losing the votes' of Paul&rsquo;s supporters after he loses the primaries? Something needs to happen. As Kirchick writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ron Paul is not going to be president. But, as his campaign has gathered steam, he has found himself increasingly permitted inside the boundaries of respectable debate. He sat for an extensive interview with Tim Russert recently. He has raised almost $20 million in just three months, much of it online. And he received nearly three times as many votes as erstwhile front-runner Rudy Giuliani in last week&rsquo;s Iowa caucus. All the while he has generally been portrayed by the media as principled and serious, while garnering praise for being a &ldquo;straight-talker.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth about this man deserves the widest possible audience.</p>

To avoid such complaints in future, he has vowed only to hire smoking employees. Other sources say the three employees were fired for other reasons. And then there’s a commenter for the story who says he made it all up.

This situation is the opposite of what I experienced in the previous two decades. The balance is tipping.</p>

			 <p>My wife is reading a crime story I got for Christmas and read over the holidays, <a href="http://www.cditfurth.de/cditfurth.htm">Christian von Ditfurth</a>, <a href="http://www.cditfurth.de/makelbuch.htm"><em>Mann ohne Makel</em></a>. It's sleuth, Josef Maria Stachelmann, is a historian of the Third Reich. Wonderful read, if you know German. Anyway, my wife asked me about the Hossbach Protocol that Stachelmann is supposed to give a talk about. My memory failed me, so I took the easy way out with Google. Bad idea.</p>
<p><a href="https://markstoneman.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hossbachprotocol.jpg"><img src="https://mrstoneman.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0cf24b6b37.jpg" alt="HossbachProtocol"></a></p>
<p>The first two hits on Google led to web sites that seek to appear legitimate, but which are in fact sites that deny the Holocaust and consider the Nuremberg Trial a travesty of justice. How did Google mess this up? Have some Nazi would-be academics learned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">search engine optimization</a> (SEO)? Or was this blind luck? I'm not sure how Google's search engine works, but the results here certainly point to the limitations of algorithms that rely on the syntactic relevance of a site. Also, while no one is linking to the articles about the Hossbach Protocol directly, there are many links to the main sites on which the articles appear. (You can determine who is linking to a site by typing link:www.name-of-site.com into the Google search box, unless the site is using the nofollow attribute in its links.) In other words, the sites appear to be popular and therefore relevant in Google's eyes. In fact, Google has blessed both sites with respectable, if not overwhelming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_rank">page ranks</a> (PR). The first one <em>Historical Revisionism</em>, comes in at a PR 4, and the second one, <em>Institute for Historical Review</em>, at PR 5 on a scale of 0 to 10.</p>
<p>Now I could stop with this warning about the limitations of Google search results, but perhaps there is more to be learned here. Perhaps I should also issue a plea to historians to both learn SEO and write for general audiences on the web. Like it or not, Google is the first place many people turn for answers, and anyone seeking one on the Hossbach Protocol can be easily led astray. Actually, historians might not even need to learn SEO. Wikipedia already has a high page rank and its pages turn up regularly at or near the top of Google search results. Perhaps all that is needed is more and better Wikipedia articles. The Hossbach Protocol doesn't show up in Wikipedia. If it had, the search results would have been different.</p>
<p>Wikipedia brings up another twist. Typically, when one uses one term in Wikipedia that is more commonly known by another, Wikipedia will at least offer alternative results. (It's better than Google that way. Google can only offer spelling alternatives.) In this case, though, the more typical American name for this document did not show up in the search results. Only after I typed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hossbach_Memorandum">Hossbach Memorandum</a> did I find what I was looking for. I then typed this term into Google and came up with much more satisfactory results. Only one of the right-wing links came up on the first page, and this time near the bottom.</p>
<p><a href="https://markstoneman.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hossbachmemorandum.jpg"><img src="https://mrstoneman.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d3524b0f50.jpg" alt="HossbachMemorandum"></a></p>
<p>This final result brings me back to Wikipedia and SEO. We need to enter all possible variations of terms in Wikipedia articles so that they show up in search results. (Sure, I should have entered "Hossbach Memorandum" right from the start, but I translated directly and that was that. As the first set of search results shows, others have done so too.) We also need to do the same thing with web articles and blog posts. It won't do to leave the field open to the bad guys, simply because the world of SEO isn't part of our training and does not make or break historical careers. I don't know if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Lipstadt">Deborah Lipstadt</a> does any SEO, but her three-year-old <a href="http://lipstadt.blogspot.com/">blog</a> combats holocaust denial and has a PR 6. More established historians need to follow her example in their respective fields.</p>

			 <p>I began blogging in May 2007 with a tumblelog on Tumblr. A tumblelog is a loose collection of images, quotes, videos, sounds, and short chunks of text. I’ve seen the genre compared to a stream of consciousness, although we’re not talking The Sound and the Fury here. In fact, there is no stream but rather bursts of varying length at random intervals. Hence one journalist has called the tumblelog the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071224141820/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2007/08/23/dltumblelogging123.xml">punk rock of blogging</a>, an apt comparison insofar as tumblelogs are also lean and often undisciplined. But punk offers more coherent narratives than most tumblelogs I’ve seen.</p>
<p>I used my tumblelog for fun and random thoughts, but soon I began blogging for real on Blogger about history and the Mac. The point was to teach and help out. The focus was narrow. My “real” blog was still my tumblelog, where I put the most interesting tidbits from past and present.</p>
<p>After some six months of blogging, however, I have found that there is much more interest in my blogs than my tumblelog. Part of the reason is that my blogs offer hard information, but my previous post suggests another compelling reason for the lukewarm response to my tumblelog. People with a natural appetite for narrative and an authentic voice leave <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071229131722/http://stoneman.tumblr.com/">my tumblelog</a> amused, perhaps, but still hungry.</p>

			 <p>Some will call me a thankless twit. Invited to spend Christmas week in Davos, Switzerland, I have been miserable for much of the time. I am staying at the Hotel Schatzalp and I have had diner twice at the Steigenberger, luxurious home of the famous World Economic Forum. I am a guest of some very kind people. I don’t have to—and couldn’t possibly—pay for this vacation. Nonetheless, I am not liking it. The company, food, scenery, and service are all excellent. Attitudes towards smoking, on the other hand, are dreadful.</p>
<p>I used to put up with smoke when I lived in Europe, but things have changed. Some four years ago I came down with asthma. Now I have to worry about more than smelly clothes, burning eyes, and the long-term consequences of second-hand smoke. I have to weigh having an asthma flare-up against offending my hosts. And they don’t even smoke. I have been drawing the line at hanging out in the smoke-filled hotel lobby, but I could hardly say no to diner on Christmas Eve, which German speakers call Heiliges Abend, the most important family evening of the year in this part of the world. No one was smoking anywhere I could see, but there was smoke in the air. Result: I had to use my rescue inhaler twice after going to bed. Normally I do not need it at all.</p>
<p>Now I have to choose between being outside or hanging out in my room. The outdoor world is beautiful here, as is the view from my room, but sooner or later a body wants coffee or beer—and company too. I cannot hang out in the beautiful lobby of my hotel, which was built some 100 years ago. I cannot enjoy the ambience of a place made famous by Thomas Mann in The Magic Mountain. I cannot visit my hosts in the Steigenberger. On the other hand, the restaurant in the Hotel Schatzalp is smoke-free, even if I have to hold my breath to get to it.</p>
<p>There is more good news on the horizon. A woman at the reception desk at the Steigenberger was actually sympathetic enough to my problem to tell me that the Swiss canton of Graubünden will go smoke-free in March. Apparently that will be the the second smoke free canton in Switzerland. The first is in the Italian-speaking part of the country. Other parts of Europe with smoking bans include Italy and Ireland, and Germany has a law on the books that will take effect in January. France will also step up its efforts to limit smoking in public places.</p>
<p>I hope these bans work. I enjoy Europe and the company of my wife’s family, but I am unwilling to give up breathing in order to see them.</p>

			 <p>I frequently encounter situations in which students pick the right word, but use it improperly in their sentence. If you are even the slightest bit unsure about how to use a word, look it up. This common-sense advice is hard to follow sometimes, because many dictionaries only give you the meaning of a word. Fortunately, there is the Oxford American Dictionary (ISBN 0380510529), which offers examples of how to use words. It also points out when two words are easily confused and explains which word is appropriate in what kind of context. EFL students at an intermediate level or higher should use the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary (ISBN 0194001164) for the same reason. This dictionary contains even more extensive usage examples.</p>

			 <p class="intro">I originally wrote this for a teaching blog called History Survey, before moving it to Language for You on this date.</p>
<p>The thesaurus is a useful tool, but it can also be dangerous. It is not enough to look for synonyms and assume that these words mean what you think they mean. If the word you found is unfamiliar, you must go the extra mile and look it up in a <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2007/12/08/dictionaries-can-tell-you-how.html">dictionary</a>. Only then will you be in a position to decide whether you have chosen the right word or not.</p>
<p>Students of foreign languages learn a similar lesson. If you want to translate English into French, for example, it is not enough to look for a French word in the English-French dictionary. You also need to double-check that word in the French-English dictionary.</p>
<p>Fortunately, these days much of this work can be done electronically—if you have a reliable dictionary. Mac users can use the built-in dictionary and thesaurus application on their computers. (Use the application, not the widget.) What makes this dictionary so great is not simply that Apple makes it easy to use, but that is based on the highly usable Oxford American Dictionary. Another tool for any operating system is <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com">Merriam-Webster</a> online, which offers plugins for Firefox and Microsoft Explorer. While I have not tried the dictionary that comes with Microsoft Word, I have seen my teenage son get some pretty bad results with it in the past. Now he uses Apple’s built-in dictionary.</p>
<p>By the way, if you like online dictionaries, one interesting place to go is <a href="https://www.onelook.com">OneLook</a>, which offers you results from a large number of dictionaries.</p>

			 <p>Samuel R. Williamson Jr and Russel Van Wyk make an interesting point on the last page of an undergraduate <a href="http://vufind-devel.carli.illinois.edu/weston1-hrt/Record/hrt_24966/TOC">documentary history</a> of the Great War's causes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the start of the new millennium, and after September 11, 2001, there is an urgent need for civilian understanding and control of the military forces of the state. Yet paradoxically, this need comes at a time when very few civilians in western society have had any direct experience in the military, either as members of the uniformed services or as students of strategic issues. Conversely, recent studies also show that many in the military have little appreciation of the American traditions of civil-military relations and even of the assumed tenets of civilian control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am unable to comment on their final assertion, but the rest of their comments speaks to a problem that has long bothered me. Why do we not teach more military history in our liberal arts programs? How can we expect our civilian leadership and the electorate more generally to make informed decisions about war and peace if we do not teach these questions in our institutions of higher learning?</p>

<p>Students who have spent many years learning English with vocabulary and grammar exercises in their home countries sometimes have a hard time speaking when they arrive in the United States. This is especially the case if the major focus of their studies has been accuracy. They hesitate to say anything for fear of it getting it wrong. Such students need training in fluency. They need to practice talking and writing without stopping to correct themselves all the time. Yes, accuracy matters, but not at the cost of not being able to speak in the first place.</p>
<p>Students who have spent many years in the United States without formal training in English frequently experience the opposite problem. They can speak fluently, that is, they can say whatever is on their minds. But often they make mistakes. These mistakes probably did not matter at first, but the student finds that now they do, especially in a professional context. Such students need to study grammar and practice speaking and writing accurately.</p>
<p>Balancing fluency and accuracy is a tricky business though. Students emphasizing fluency still need to keep grammar in mind, and students improving their accuracy dare not become so concerned about accuracy that they can no longer speak easily. The trick is to find a healthy balance, and that balance will be different for each student.</p>

<p>Yesterday I <a href="http://markstoneman.com/2007/10/08/1834/">wrote</a> about the present in this blog about my work with the past. What possible justification could I have for doing that? (I mean besides the obvious point that this is <em>my</em> blog.)</p>
<p>I wrote about outsourcing military functions in Iraq not because I possess special knowledge of the subject, but because my expertise in history makes me frame the issue in ways that are different from what I find in the media. I do not possess any special insight into what we should do about the Iraq War now, but I know that there are some issues from past wars that I am not seeing raised today. Historians are on solid epistemological ground when they raise such issues.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I find the American Historical Association's official <a href="http://blog.historians.org/news/166/iraq-war-resolution-is-ratified-by-aha-members">condemnation</a> of the war last year problematic. An organization of historians has no business claiming expertise in making war and peace. Instead I wish it would devote more attention to the study of war and society in the past. Then its individual members could participate in the framing of debates about war and peace in our own times, if they so desire.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p class="intro">This post originally appeared on Clio and Me (now closed) on this date.</p>
<p>There has been much scrutiny in the press recently about the U.S. outsourcing military missions to private companies like Blackwater. P. W. Singer pointed out many <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/05/AR2007100501677.html?referrer=delicious">problems</a> with this trend in yesterday's <em>Washington Post</em>. The most important from my point of view is the weak link between the American people and warmaking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the end of the Vietnam War, the United States has sought to ensure that there's a link between the public and the costs of war, so that good decisions will be made and an ethos of responsibility fostered. With about half our operation in Iraq in private hands, that link has been jeopardized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps we live in a new world that I do not understand, but it seems to me that the past several hundred years of Western history have shown that a people at war can create a far more powerful political and military force than anything a cabinet can muster on its own. If the war in Iraq is so important, this country's citizens should be more directly involved, for they are the real basis of American power. But they are also a brake on the reckless use of military force. They will only mobilize for compelling reasons. One of President Bush's mistakes was to go to war with only enough public support to begin it. There is no such thing as war on the cheap. Private contractors are expensive in mere dollars, but they have helped the administration to avoid seeking a more solid domestic political foundation for the war&mdash;or accepting the consequences if it is unable to do so.</p>
<p>Framing his piece as an open memorandum to the secretaries of defense and state, Singer devotes most of his attention to how counterproductive private military forces are on the ground. This line of thought is more likely to gain an audience than the more immediate focus in the media on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/washington/02cnd-blackwater.html?ex=1349064000&en=2c3e29ccb2b2d94a&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">accountability</a> of men working for outfits like Blackwater. Yes, Congress needs to implement a legal framework for these men who stand outside both Iraqi law and the United States' own Uniform Code of Military Justice, but a strong concern for the rule of law and human rights has not been this administrations' strong suit.</p>
<p>We also need to hear more about the organizational culture of Blackwater. Since it hires men with prior military experience, this requirement includes learning more about the military cultures whence they came, especially since Blackwater hires people of diverse national backgrounds, including people with experience in outfits with less than stellar human rights records. The question of military culture brings me back to the initial point about the weak link between the American people and the violence being done in its name in Iraq. The U.S. Army and Marines have their own organizational cultures, but these include a strong link to values in American civilian society. Can we say the same thing about our hired guns?</p>
<p>Of course, the abuses at <a href="http://www.jurist.org/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C15%2C21%2C&search=%22Abu+Ghraib%22&limit=25&page=&author=&limit_by_date=true&date_range_start=2007-09-01&date_range_end=2007-10-08&filtered=true&narrow=&authored=false">Abu Ghraib</a> show that our own military culture has some problems, though I suspect that the atrocities committed there had much to do with the inexperience of National Guard troops, a different culture in the CIA, the use of civilian defense contractors, and some troubling signals being sent from the highest levels of our civilian government, not to mention unclear lines of command and accountability.</p>

			 <p class="intro">Georgetown University in Washington, DC, did not cancel classes on September 12th, so I went into a class packed with mainly freshman at 9:15 a.m. By that point teaching early modern European history was out of the question, so we talked. After I got home, I sent the following message to everyone.</p>
<p>Date: Wednesday, September 12, 2001 12:56<br />Subject: reflections</p>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Frankly, I was surprised by the rather large turnout in class this morning. Yesterday's news was disturbing, and many of us feel worse as the details and reality of the terrorist attacks sink in. The class discussion was heartening for me, because I saw a large group of curious, thinking, politically astute and morally aware students, who will one day help to lead this country. There is still much to learn (for your professors too), but your remarks show that you want to learn. This desire to learn about and engage in the world might help give a little meaning to the tragedy.</p>
<p>Those of you who did not come to class leave me worried. Was it because of the general sad and bewildered atmosphere that has enveloped this city? Or have you lost family members or friends? I do not expect an answer to these questions, but I do want to point out two things to all students. First, those of you who feel despondent, in shock, depressed, angry, or confused should know that this is normal. You should also know that such feelings can be extremely debilitating if you cannot address them in some way. Make sure you seek out counselors, chaplains, advisors, professors, friends or family members for assistance. Some of you will find your academic work a good diversion--or way of understanding what happened. If, however, your personal situation makes such work impossible, because of depression or family obligations, please also visit your dean, who can run interference for you with your instructors.</p>
<p>Student reactions in class covered a wide spectrum of opinion and emotions, which I would like to summarize. Some of you appeared numbed or angered by the attack and could not yet put it into some sort of abstract moral or political framework. Others were outraged at the apparent insensitivity some people showed towards this great loss. These are normal reactions, and I imagine most of you have felt or will feel similarly, at least for a time. Many of you pondered what the U.S. reaction should be. While some expressed concerns about the morality and justice of retribution, others worried about what application of force might actually work. Who was behind these atrocities and what would be the most efficacious manner of dealing with them? One of you pointed out that any political or military reactions must consider the mindset of the terrorists, their cultural assumptions and psychological make-up. We cannot assume that they think as we do. Some of you talked about what yesterday's event meant for your sense of security in the U.S. This concern appeared to waver between two poles: our own physical security and the impact that this violence will have on our own humanity. I underscored the latter concern. Finally, Anton [my TA that semester] pointed out that coming to terms with many of the big conflicts in our day entails learning how to ask the right questions. Besides learning about what happened in the past, our course provides an opportunity for you to learn how to ask trenchant questions.</p>
<p>Finally, some personal notes: A friend of ours in Augsburg, Germany (north of Munich) called this morning to find out how we are doing. She says no one in Augsburg is talking about anything else. They are horrified. My mother-in-law in Munich spoke of a minute of silence being observed today in the textile industry (probably elsewhere too). As far as my friends in New York go, well, it is impossible to get through on the phone. One can only hope and, if one is so inclined, pray.</p>
<p>I encourage you to participate in the university's various forums for dialog today, and to listen to or read some quality news, such as NPR radio, The Washington Post, and so on. Some of you might also read the foreign press online. Participating in the country's and world's dialog is good not only for your intellectual development, but also for your mental health.</p>
<p>Take care of yourselves.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Mark Stoneman</p>

			 <p>Historical scholarship can be as much the result of accident as planning. How on earth did I come to write a dissertation on Wilhelm Groener? I thought I liked doing social history, not biography. If I studied the army, I was more apt to find common soldiers interesting, not a general who assumed operational control of the whole army at the end of the First World War and who people addressed as "Your Excellency." I was also not particularly interested in military-technical questions. Yes, I found the questions about humanity in warfare that I had explored in my M.A. thesis compelling. But German war planning for the First World War? And the German general staff's experience of the war? These were not my things either, or so I thought. Besides, were not many meters of library shelf-space filled with books on these problems?</p>
<p>I first looked at Wilhelm Groener in a research seminar whose theme was the German bourgeoisie in Imperial Germany. Historians were devoting much renewed attention to this social class in the 1990s, because earlier interpretations had blamed the German middle class for not being middle-class enough and not doing what any bourgeoisie supposedly should have done, which was to put Prussia's powerful nobility in its place and establish a proper constitutional monarchy. Germany's unfortunate authoritarian modern history was attributed to an abstract process of maldevelopment, a German special path or <em>Sonderweg</em>, along which the bourgeoisie had failed to do what it allegedly had done in Britain and France, that is, rise up in a bourgeois revolution that made everything normal. New research on the middle class was beginning to undermine this view. Far from aping the nobility, the bourgeoisie had developed a self-confident, vibrant class culture. Our task in the seminar was to examine this research and consider its implications for understanding the broader outline—or grand narrative—of modern German history.</p>
<p>I eventually decided to concentrate on the officer corps, because it played a key role in the narrative of German exceptionalism. The nobility had dominated the officer corps and made it an illiberal force in society more generally. According to this narrative, birth, not military know-how, had played a decisive role in military careers. Hence, not only had the military been illiberal, but its leaders had allegedly not kept up with the times. Parallel to this version of the officer corps, however, existed another in which the German general staff had been the preeminent professional military organization in the world. Which, if any, of these interpretations was right? Here was an opportunity to examine the military in a mainstream historiographical context. The German bourgeoisie was receiving a lot of attention in the historiography, but the military—so central to the German Sonderweg thesis—remained largely untouched by this research.</p>
<p>So I did a comparative research paper on August Keim, Erich Ludendorff, and Wilhelm Groener, all commoners and all general staffers in Imperial Germany. I chose these men because there were enough published primary sources in Washington, DC to make a research paper viable. I showed that these men all had adhered to the mainstream bourgeois values that the new historiography identified, and I demonstrated that no contradiction between a military and a bourgeois ethos had existed. These commoners had not been "feudalized" by their aristocratic comrades-in-arms.</p>
<p>Considering these issues without reference to the First World War was unthinkable, so I also explored Keim's, Ludendorff's, and Groener's images of war. After all, the feudal interpretation of the officer corps included a charge of aristocratic anachronism. Unfortunately, I was unable to link their social backgrounds and images of war, except to point out that their images of war comported with contemporary developments. Nonetheless, the work proved fruitful enough to suggest the possibility of a dissertation on one of these officers, Wilhelm Groener. I could use his biography as a vehicle for analyzing the sociology and culture of the Imperial German officer corps.</p>

			 <p><a href="http://www.coldwar.org/">The Cold War Museum</a> does not yet have a permanent home, but you can visit it on the web. While I welcome this resource, I am disappointed that it focuses almost exclusively on the military side of this conflict. What about the Cold War's broader impact on culture, politics, and the economy?</p>
<p>I suppose the museum's current focus cannot be helped, given its close relationship with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070827182038/https://www.coldwarveterans.com/">Cold War Veterans Association</a>, with which it issues a quarterly electronic newsletter. This association seeks recognition for the service of Cold War veterans and promotes the memory of what was in no small part their achievement. Still, veterans would do well to remember the strong connections between military and civilian life. U.S. armed forces did not simply protect the homeland. The Cold War was fought on the home front too. And what about the relationship between the American home front and U.S. military forces deployed around the world?</p>
<p>I hope the museum also finds more room for critical analysis than the website currently evinces. While I understand the need for celebration, the Cold War Museum and the Cold War Veterans Association need to ask tougher questions, especially with regard to the Cold War's impact on the current state of our military and its relationship with civilian society. This is more than simply an academic question. Do not the men and women that our country places in harm's way deserve honest scholarship that can help the military to become an even more effective instrument of war and peace?</p>

<br>
Meet Wilhelm Groener, an unassuming Swabian of modest social provenance who rose to the number two position in the Imperial German army by the end of the First World War. Here he is in about 1920, soon after his retirement from the army in the young Weimar Republic.
<p>Groener, the subject of my dissertation, informed Kaiser Wilhelm II in November 1918 that the army would not follow him back to Prussia to fight a civil war to quash the revolution. Confronted with this reality, Wilhelm II abdicated and fled to the Netherlands.</p>
<p>By rights Groener&rsquo;s boss, Chief of the General Staff Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, should have delivered the bad news, but he was a Prussian officer and nobleman, imbued in the traditions of military service to his supreme war lord, the Prussian king and German emperor. Hindenburg did not have the nerve.</p>
<p>Groener was present at the death of another German regime too. He served as minister of defense from 1928 to 1932. Near the end of this tenure he was also acting minister of the interior in the Brüning cabinet. In this capacity he pushed to outlaw Hitler&rsquo;s brown-shirts, the S.A., which gave right-wing extremists in the army a chance to withdraw their support of the defense minister and prevail upon President Hindenburg to withdraw his confidence from Groener, who then resigned. Soon the rest of the cabinet did too, and Hitler came to power less than a year later.</p>
<p>Groener witnessed and participated in some of modern Germany&rsquo;s key political events, but that is not what I wrote about in my dissertation. Instead, I focussed on the relationship between his social background and military career, which was interesting precisely because he rose to such prominence in an organization alleged to have been the exclusive playground of the Prussian nobility.</p>
<p>At least that is how my research started.</p>

			 <p>History can be used to justify all manner of circumstances in the present. Want to justify an authoritarian regime in Russia? Referring to Russia&rsquo;s present conditions can help, but even more effective can be skillful tradition-building that shows Russia&rsquo;s long line of great authoritarian rulers. And what better place to start than with history teachers in the schools?</p>
<p><em>The New York Times</em> published <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/weekinreview/12kramer.html?ex=1344657600&en=27185b016a9c24c7&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">a remarkable article</a> yesterday about a new history guide for high school teachers in Russia. After a brief introduction, it offers verbatim excerpts on Stalin, who comes away smelling like roses, despite his massive purges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stalin followed Peter the Great’s logic: demand the impossible from the people in order to get the maximum possible. . . . The result of Stalin’s purges was a new class of managers capable of solving the task of modernization in conditions of shortages of resources, loyal to the supreme power and immaculate from the point of view of executive discipline. . . .</p>
<p>Thus, just like Chancellor Bismarck who united German lands into a single state by “iron and blood,” Stalin was reinforcing his state by cruelty and mercilessness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is quite an intellectual feat to bring Stalin into line with both Peter the Great and Otto von Bismarck. Indeed, such relativism reveals something about the Kremlin&rsquo;s self-image these days. It would be helpful to see the rest of the guide before drawing broader conclusions. Still, does not the following statement recall some of Putin&rsquo;s own criticisms of democracy in the United States in recent years?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Political and historical studies show that when they come under similarly serious threats, even “soft” and “flexible” political systems, as a rule, turn more rigid and limit individual rights, as happened in the United States after September 11, 2001.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, history textbooks matter.</p>

<p>These stereoptic cards offer a tale of war reduced to two basic elements: soldiers on parade at home followed by the unburied corpses of soldiers on the battlefield. How should we read this story? At first glance, it seems to be about the gap between dreams and reality in war: the transformation of men from objects of admiration in society to a meal for rats, bugs, worms, and microbes in a foreign wasteland. In other words, the pictures seem to tell a story about the utter senselessness of the First World War. But does that interpretation do justice to the lives of these men? Does it tell us why they wore the uniform and sacrificed their lives? Does it tell us about their experience of war? And what about the politicians and generals who sent millions to their deaths? Can we write them off as insane or incompetent fools? Or should we take them seriously and try to fathom their mental universe? Finally, what lasting effects did this violence and loss have on the societies that fought this war? These are some of the questions that inform my interest in military history.</p>

			 <p class="intro">This post originally appeared on Clio and Me (now closed) on this date.</p>
<p>When I went to the student coffee shop on Friday, the student at the cash register guessed my order before I could tell him what I wanted. I remarked that I had had similar experiences with regulars when I worked at a Dunkin' Donuts over twenty years ago. His response: &ldquo;They had Dunkin' Donuts back then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For me there has always been a Dunkin' Donuts. Indeed, according to Wikipedia and the corporate website of Dunkin' Donuts, the first store opened in 1950, which is close enough to &ldquo;always&rdquo; for someone born in the early 1960s. So why did the student think Dunkin' Donuts was new? His own answer was eminently practical: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t even been alive for twenty years.&rdquo; Still, his underlying assumption that so much of the world around him was new took me aback.</p>
<p>Maybe I should not have been surprised by his presentism. After all, the current generation of students has grown up hearing that they live in a completely different world than the one into which I was born. They have heard from their parents and teachers about a bygone world in the midst of a Cold War without personal computing, the internet, cell phones, iPods, and global warming. And then there are the many students who have grown up in new subdivisions, schools and strip malls.</p>
<p>What do these thoughts have to do with me and Clio? One of my main goals in undergraduate survey courses is to teach historical thinking, which in part entails helping students appreciate not only that the world has a past, but that the people in that past saw that world through different eyes. But it is not enough for me to ask them to see how the world looks when it is filtered through the experiences of earlier generations. In order to do my job, I find it helps if I meet them halfway and try to understand how the world looks when filtered through their experiences. Of course, I usually end up looking uncool in the process, but as the father of a teenager I am used to that.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was looking through Friedrich Dürrenmatt&rsquo;s <em>The Physicists</em>, a play I have used a few times in a survey course on modern Europe. In the back of the English translation by James Kirkup are &ldquo;21 Points to The Physicists,&rdquo; one of which reads, &ldquo;The more human beings proceed by plan the more effectively they may be hit by accident.&rdquo; This quote sums up my recently completed dissertation on three levels that I would like to consider: the content of my research from the point of view of its historical subjects, the path my research takes from my point of view, and the shape of the narrative that eventually emerges. I plan to look at these paradoxes in future posts at irregular intervals. For now I will mention a different one that is not as difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>I spent four years in the U.S. Army during peacetime, and I disliked being a soldier. I also rarely found military history interesting. Nonetheless, my research has focused on war. My M.A. thesis is about Bavarian soldiers and French civilians in the Franco-Prussian War, and my Ph.D. thesis is about the Imperial German officer corps and war planning. How did a former soldier who hated his experience in the military come to enjoy studying military history?</p>
<p>At least part of the answer lies in my military experience. A kid from the woods of New Hampshire had a lot of learning to do in a unit in which most everyone else came from the inner city or rural south. Add class, race, and educational levels to this mix, and I got a first-rate education. You see, I was not just in the army, but combat arms, specifically, the field artillery. When I enlisted I made the naive assumption that the army was the army no matter what one did, and it was offering a substantial bonus for four years in the artillery. So why not? Without going into a longer story, let me say that I left the army in 1987 with an insight of which at the time I was unaware: studying the army can teach a person a lot about that army&rsquo;s country.</p>
<p>Not until I was doing my M.A. in Augsburg, Germany did I realize that I knew this. I think it was late 1992 or early 1993 when I met Professor Stig Förster, who had just returned to Europe from a stint at the German Historical Institute in Washington, DC. Stig was editing <em>On the Road to Total War: The American Civil War and the German Wars of Unification, 1861-1871</em>, and I, as an American there, was recruited as one of his student helpers. I found the topics interesting, because in a seminar I had recently taken with another historian, we had learned about the lead-up to the war and the postwar settlement, but the war just kind of happened. I remarked on this circumstance to Stig. One thing led to another and he suggested I could explore the Bavarians' treatment of civilians in 1870–71 for my master&rsquo;s thesis. The topic sounded interesting, but also vaguely pornographic. Was it even decent to probe into such suffering? At the same time, scenes from Bosnia on TV suggested to me that such topics mattered. Before making up my mind, I asked if there was an historical treatment of these kinds of issues that might show me the historical value of examining atrocities. That led to Michael Fellman, <em>Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict In Missouri During The American Civil War</em>, as well as James M. McPherson, <em>Battle Cry Of Freedom: The Civil War Era</em>. Of course, I also dug into Michael Howard&rsquo;s perennial <em>The Franco-Prussian War: The German Invasion of France, 1870-71</em>. These books showed me that the study of war was integral to mainstream history and vice versa. With war being fought once again on European soil (the Balkans), I not only was hooked, but I thought such studies were a moral imperative.</p>
<p>Having completed a PhD program and many years of teaching, I no longer see my research in such grandiose terms. Still, I try to integrate at least one lecture on broad trends in war and society into each survey course I teach. I think students need to know that human behavior in war is historically contingent. They need to know, for instance, that humanity and atrocities in warfare have a history. The list is much longer, of course, but I can revisit the topic another time.</p>

			 <p>Do partisan politics have a place in the classroom? No. On the other hand, in a history class it is hard, even impossible to discuss many subjects without politics forming a subtext of the conversation. This difficulty is especially inherent in modern history. How, for example, can we talk about state-building, gender roles, participatory politics, and political ideologies without entering terrain in which we have a personal stake? And once we do that, how do we keep out partisan politics?</p>
<p>The trick is to make that difficult mental leap into the past and try to understand it from the point of view of people who lived in that time. We do not need to take sides with our ideological forefathers, and we do not need to attack their opponents. Nor do we need to respond to problems in the past with solutions from the present. Instead we need to try to think historically. We need to try to understand people in the past in their historical contexts. Making that leap is difficult, but possible.</p>
<p>Ironically, good civic practices are one potential side-effect of cultivating such historical sensibilities. If we can learn to imagine how people thought in the past, maybe we can imagine how our political opponents think in the present. Once we reach that point, a genuine dialog might be possible. The problems might be just as inextricable, but we might learn how to talk with each other instead of at each other. In other words, when we study history, it is possible to acquire the communicative habits necessary for a healthy civic culture. Partisan politics do not belong in the classroom, but the classroom might have some lessons for partisan politics.</p>

			 <p class="intro">This post originally appeared on this date on a short-lived Blogger site of mine, On My Mac. I've updated a few of the links and left others pointing to the versions archived by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000857/http://onmymac.blogspot.com/search/label/outliners">Wayback Machine</a></p>
<p>I find that I can organize my thoughts best with a <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2007/06/19/writing-tools-mindmapping.html">mind-mapping</a> application, but some people do better with an outliner. If you have Microsoft Word, you already have an outliner. Simply create a new document, go to the View menu, and choose Outline. What to do next? To get you started, here is an image of a sample outline with some rudimentary instructions. Keep in mind that Word behaves differently in its &ldquo;Outline&rdquo; view than in its &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; or &ldquo;Page Layout&rdquo; views.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/166262/2025/outline.jpg" alt="Old screen shot of Word used as an outliner. The text describes what the various bits are." style="padding: 2rem;">
</div>
<p>Now play with your Word outline and read the help files as necessary. Alternatively, you might download OmniGroup&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OmniOutliner">OmniOutliner</a> and play with it for 30 days. Make sure you try the tutorials and look at the sample files. You might also try the simple and free <a href="https://amarsagoo.info/deepnotes/">Deep Notes</a>. If playing with these applications makes you want to learn more, I suggest that you begin reading Ted Goranson&rsquo;s helpful series <a href="https://atpm.com/Back/atpo.shtml">About this Particular Outliner</a> on ATPM. Scroll to the bottom of the page to read the articles in chronological order. The most important ones deal with features, usage scenarios, and user interfaces. After that you can read in-depth reviews of individual products. Whatever you do, remember that you are not looking for the best outliner, but the outliner that you work best with, if you find that outlining is for you.</p>

I pulled it from the Wayback Machine, and the links point to pages archived at that time.</p>
<p>When I have complex ideas to work through or no idea where to begin with a new project, I often try to sort things out with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000734/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_Mapping">mind map</a>, that is, a diagram of the problem I am facing. I can do this with pen and paper, or pen and index cards, or even pen and sticky notes, but I prefer to use a mind-mapping application. On the computer I can move things around quickly, and I can experiment with different structures. I could do the same thing with index cards or sticky notes, but that requires a large working area, and I can&rsquo;t take the table or wall I&rsquo;m using with me when I go to the office or library.</p>
<p>My favorite mind-mapping tool is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000734/http://www.mindcad.com/">Incubator</a> by MindCad, because it is easy to learn and use. The price is up to $50 now, but you might find it is worth every penny. There are also free mind-mapping applications, including the simple, but functional <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000734/http://www.sebastian-krauss.de/software/">MyMind</a> and the more feature-rich, but also more complicated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000734/http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">FreeMind</a>. Two popular commercial products are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000734/http://www.inspiration.com/productinfo/inspiration/index.cfm">Inspiration</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000734/http://www.nova-mind.com/">NovaMind</a>, both of which offer more features&ndash;and cost more&ndash;than Incubator. Some people need these features, but I find they get in my way. The simplicity of Incubator helps me stay on task.</p>
<p>I find mind mapping is best suited for beginning a lecture, essay, or other project, and then I move to an outliner or word processor. Some people use mind-mapping applications to keep track of tasks and manage complex projects. I could also imagine using this kind of application to study for an exam. My advice: Begin by looking for screenshots of these applications on the sites linked here. Then try out these applications and see how you work with them.</p>
<p>Windows Users: FreeMind, NovaMind, and Inspiration will work on your computer too. Mac and Windows users alike can find more applications by doing a search on VersionTracker. There is also a long list of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000734/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mind_mapping_software">mind-mapping software</a> on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>The dictionary application on the Mac is an essential writing tool. I am not talking about the dictionary widget, which has minimal functionality. I mean the application that comes with every Mac. What is the difference? The application lets you spell things wrong and still finds the right word. The widget demands perfect spelling. Also, unlike the widget, the application lets you click on any word in any entry to find its definition. In functional terms, this is a nifty application. Even better, though, the dictionary itself is of excellent quality, since it comes from the Oxford American Dictionary. I have long used the paperback version of that because it contains not only reliable definitions, but also good examples of how to use the word properly, not to mention articles to help you choose the right word when several are closely related. Apple&rsquo;s program also includes a thesaurus, which is icing on the cake.…</p>

I pulled it from the Wayback Machine, and the links point to pages archived at that time.</p>
<p>Last semester I had over 90 students. Because my commute via bus, train, and bus again was pretty long and my book bag was already full, I decided to collect and give feedback for all assignments electronically. Some assignments were informal email reports of various activities the students did, so I did not bother to correct grammar. Still, replying to each one of those reports was time-consuming, so I looked for a way to automate part of the process. First, I read each report and wrote comments, but I entered those comments in my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000747/http://www.filemaker.com/">FileMaker</a> database, where I kept the students' grades; I did not write an individual email for each student. Second, when I finished all the grading, I exported the data to a tab-separated text file. Third, I turned to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000747/http://www.falkon-ware.com/SerialMailer/">SerialMailer</a>, which can import such files (or a mailing list from Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000747/http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/addressbook/">Address Book</a>). After importing the file, I wrote one email with field names from the imported file. All I had to do then was hit send and all the messages went out at once, each one individualized with name, comments, and grade. If I had someone who did not fit this pattern, I could send them an individual email. If I had several such people, I could use conditional fields in SerialMailer. Anyone who has to correspond regularly with a large group of people would find this application useful.</p>
<p>SerialMailer was not as well suited for student papers. Those I converted to PDF files, which I commented and marked up with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000747/http://www.smileonmymac.com/PDFpen/index.html">PDFpen</a>. (PDFpen has since added new editing markup tools, which I have not yet tried.) Then I had to send each file back individually, because SerialMailer can only send the same attachment to all recipients. Before sending, I shrank the files with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000747/http://onmymac.blogspot.com/2007/05/one-great-feature-of-mac-is-its-ability.html">PDFshrink</a>, if they had become large.</p>
<p>That is how I handled the first of two paper assignments. Experience tells me that students are less likely to read such detailed comments at the end of the semester, so I handled those the same way as I did for the informal reports&mdash;SerialMailer and Filemaker. My comments, though, also addressed grammar and style. (By the way, I&rsquo;m still using Filemaker 5.5, which meets all my needs. I got it with educational pricing at the beginning of the decade.)</p>
<p>I will not be dealing with papers electronically this summer, because I am teaching near where I live, have regular access to an office, and have only thirty students. Moreover, I see these students five days a week. The small number of students also means that I can handle my record keeping with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000747/http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/excel2004/excel2004.aspx?pid=excel2004">Microsoft Excel</a> on my 12&quot; screen. Even in this situation, though, I imagine I will still have quite a lot of use for SerialMailer. And I know I will be turning to electronic grading and feedback this fall, when I might have as many as 100 students who I only see twice a week.</p>
<p>Teaching, advising, and managing students via email still requires a lot of individual emails though. I prefer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000747/http://www.barebones.com/products/mailsmith/index.shtml">MailSmith</a>, but a couple computer issues this spring made me switch to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000747/http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/">Mail</a> (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000747/http://www.indev.ca/MailTags.html">MailTags</a>). The problem? Mailsmith does not do <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630000747/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imap">IMAP</a>. That is normally okay, but it created some problems for me when my computer was down and I had to use more than one computer in more than one location. Only with IMAP could I synchronize my correspondence across computers and email clients.</p>

<p>Writing is hard work for almost everyone, no matter how talented or inspired. Writing is thinking. Good writers do not usually have finished ideas that they then type out. The process of writing and revision is an act of thinking and discovery. That is why writing papers can be so frustrating and rewarding at the same time. Want to improve your prose? Keep a journal, in which you produce a page of text per day. The text can be about anything, but use standard prose, not the kind of abbreviations and lack of capitalization that you might use in informal emails or IMs with friends. The text should also be honest. This exercise is akin to doing regular physical exercise, practicing music, or learning a foreign language. The more you do it, the better you get. The less you do it, the worse you get.</p>
