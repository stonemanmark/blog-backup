			 <p>One thousand days since Russia&rsquo;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. One thousand days, and we still have our heads in our duffle bags. No efforts to lead public opinion on why higher levels of support are necessary. No significant build-up of our industrial base to put paid to Putin&rsquo;s ambitions. And we&rsquo;re still hamstringing Ukraine in its ability to strike the Russian war machine where it needs striking.</p>

<p>The notice in the bottom-right corner reads &ldquo;Copyright 1919, The Stanley Service Co.&rdquo; According to the Library of Congress Copyright Office&rsquo;s <em>Catalogue of Copyright Entries</em> for that year, the company in question was the Stanley Industrial Educational Poster Service in Cleveland, Ohio. This provenance suggests to me that employers were being offered this messaging for their workers, even if the artist portrayed the immigrants as fresh arrivals.</p>

			 <p>Local and regional newspapers have been dying at an alarming rate. At the same time, the 2024 election has underscored significant failings in the best of our big newspapers: bothsidesism, clickbait headlines, groupthink and superficial analysis, sexism, casual racism, transphobia, pedantic fact-checking that doesn&rsquo;t consider substance, uncritical repetition of lies from the temperamental orange guy and those who have sworn fealty to him, sanewashing, interference with editorial decisions by billionaire owners, and so on. While there&rsquo;s currently no living entirely without such outlets, relying on them exclusively isn&rsquo;t an option. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve started to gather links to other sources as I run across them.

			 <p>The GOP will have the House too?! If so, the question becomes, does the GOP party leader, the orange dementor, control both chambers of Congress? Or will some of these folks remember that they control a separate branch of government? In the Soviet Union, the General Secretary of the Communist Party ran the show. Is that what the GOP wants? Or are they just enjoying a ride on the winning candidate&rsquo;s coattails? I&rsquo;m sure lots of them can be kept in line with threats of physical harm or the release of komprimat, and others could be bought off with spending largesse (read: corruption) by the government and by would-be beneficiaries of government contracts.</p>
<p>Wild cards: How narrow is the GOP majority in the House? Will GOP replacements for the big rotten cheese&rsquo;s cabinet picks be able to beat Democrats in those districts?</p>

			 <p>I was quite startled by these and related images from 1917 because they show a lot of men being rounded up for removal in box cars in the hot dessert sun. It turns out that this was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisbee_Deportation">Bisbee Deportation</a> of IWW strikers in 1917. Some 1,300 people were kidnapped and put on a train in the summer heat by a 2,200-man posse. The action, ordered by Phelps Dodge, was illegal but supposedly not covered by federal law, only state law, and the state never prosecuted. In fact, one photographer, Dix, saw a money-making opportunity in the forcible removal of workers from Arizona to New Mexico. The Library of Congress holds the first, darker image below as a photo print, whereas it has the other three lighter images by the same photographer as postcards, suggesting the existence of at least a local market for souvenirs.</p>

			 <p>My mother has been watching her church service online so she can hear it. That means I hear parts too. And I can see what&rsquo;s happening on the desktop I&rsquo;m streaming to the TV with. Different vibe today. Pastor began by inviting people to settle, to be present, to allow themselves to have their feelings. I also saw more people in attendance than is often the case. The service emphasized themes such as inclusion, compassion, and justice, the last term describing something very different from the hypocritical, moralizing, vengeful God that I despised and rejected in my youth. If I had a religious bone left in my body, this place could be one point of connection with the local community.</p>

			 <p>I can&rsquo;t help but think that the Kremlin once again misunderstands the situation, as they did in February 2022. Sure, the next U.S. president likes rubbing elbows with &ldquo;tough guy&rdquo; dictators, and the guardrails of expertise and institutions mean nothing to him; nevertheless, he won&rsquo;t be completely free to do as he pleases. Think of the old guard Republicans who know what&rsquo;s at stake in Europe. Enough of them were able to convince the guy in Mar-a-Lago to tell Mike Johnson to finally approve funds for Ukraine earlier this year. More importantly, even if his supporters are gung-ho America Firsters, they feel threatened by China, Putin&rsquo;s close ally. If they haven&rsquo;t put two and two together about the global ramifications of Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, their obsession with tariffs has everything to do with China, Russia&rsquo;s closest supporter.</p>
<p>In fact, will the jumping, hooting, squealing Mr. Cybertruck&rsquo;s interests in China throw a spanner in his current machinations to treat our government like an extension of his personal business interests? Mr. Orange-in-a-Suit&rsquo;s supporters are expecting action on China, and their guy with the tie needs their adulation&mdash;not to mention their votes in the 2026 midterms. Besides, how open will his oil guys be to welcoming Russia back to legitimate global oil and natural gas markets while prices are low? I can&rsquo;t claim to know all the variables, and I know the occupant of the White House matters a great deal. Still, as unpredictable, unscrupulous, inhumane, and disloyal as Mr. Bad Hairpiece is, he will not be operating in a vacuum free from the influence of powerful players calling in their chits.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, there can be no doubt that the Russian terrorist-in-chief and his security apparatus have already proven how blinkered they were about Ukraine, not to mention the unity NATO has projected. It is equally nonsensical for the Kremlin to think of NATO as a collection of American-led satellite states, pace Russia&rsquo;s rabid propagandists Margarita Simonyan and Vladimir Soloviev. Why should the Kremlin understand the United States any better, if it can&rsquo;t even acknowledge Ukrainian agency? And just how well would the next U.S. president respond to threats, when Putin realizes that flattery won&rsquo;t get him what he wants in Ukraine.</p>

Mr. Huge Crowd&rsquo;s pardoning of war criminals last time round suggests how little he understands military morale and discipline.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I doubt I&rsquo;ll have the bandwidth to follow the machinations in Washington&rsquo;s halls of power, as I did during the previous administration. I got out of the habit under the current one because I was exhausted, didn&rsquo;t feel threatened, and ended up living a twelve-hour drive away. And now I want to focus on the parts of my life and world where my individual agency, talents, and interests might be leveraged for things more constructive, more life-affirming.</p>
<p>First, though, I&rsquo;ll allow myself to imagine some of the worst coming our way, just to get the darkness out of my mind and into words: the destruction of the regulatory state and of our public medical, environmental, climate, and weather research infrastructure; the violent and cruel erasure of entire communities; the enslavement, indentured servitude, or other forms of abusive exploitation of people without papers under the &ldquo;protection&rdquo; of unscrupulous employers, landlords, neighbors, and government agents; the creation of a new generation of Hoovervilles inhabited by people with no health insurance, no immunizations, and pensioners whose Social Security checks and Medicare benefits no longer keep them housed; preventable contagious diseases killing our children; lawfully mandated medical malpractice killing girls, women, and trans men with the bad luck to become pregnant; the loss of LGBTQ+ family, friends, and community members to exile, to self-harm, and to the violence of bullies given license by their chosen leader; the possibility that insulin might grow out of my reach; the knowledge that Medicare will never cover the costs of help with elder care while I still need such help, and while private equity funds squeeze what they can out of old folks homes, leaving them woefully understaffed, their populations vulnerable to contagious disease, inattention, and abuse.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to go this way, not even under the next president. But do we think a GOP-controlled Senate will respect the filibuster the next time around, if they manage to get the House too? Isn&rsquo;t that just one more convention that the next president can demand they drop? And have any of them demonstrated even the slightest willingness to defend their institution, sure in the knowledge that they are part of a separate branch of government? GOP representatives in the House are no better, as they demonstrated during the previous president&rsquo;s two impeachments.</p>
<p>American presidents have enormous amounts of power, and now, it seems, controlling the party and the mob will give the next president even more. Or will some Republican legislators put their constituents ahead of the slash-and-burn ideologues? What groups will they decide government might have a role in protecting? Of course, the House could still flip Democratic. Some Republicans could develop a conscience. Or the ambitions, incompetence, and contradictory aims, values, and beliefs of Orange Face&rsquo;s supporters could lead to lots of friendly fire and delays.</p>
<p>Caveat: the GOP marched in lockstep to regain the presidency, but we have no idea what goes on behind the scenes. It&rsquo;s possible they prefer to carry out dissent internally. It&rsquo;s also a sure thing that Mr. Red Tie will keep all eyes on himself, with lots of help from the media, while the poisons are concocted in Congress and in other parts of the executive branch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mammoth stereopticon&rdquo;, at the corner of Broadway and Twenty-Second Street. &ldquo;By means of a stereoscopic apparatus and magic lantern, the telegrams [of election results] are rapidly copied on a glass plate, and then put in the apparatus. Large crowds assemble till early in the morning, to watch the returns, which are shown on the wall of some building, covered with a large white sheet.&quot;&ndash;from source periodical.</p>

<h4 id="taking-votes-in-a-railway-car-aka-polling-voter-intentions-bottom">&ldquo;Taking Votes in a Railway Car&rdquo; aka Polling Voter Intentions (bottom)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is a common thing to take votes in the railway carriages during election campaigns, though strictly speaking, it is not so much taking a vote as ascertaining approximately which candidate will have the best chance. Each passenger enters the name of his choice on a piece of paper, and a gentleman, generally a politician, takes his hat and collects the votes. Bets are offered and taken, and after the scrutiny animated discussions arise, each man endeavouring to persuade his opponents.&quot;&ndash;from source periodical.</p>

			 <p>For more than 25 years, I had no representation in Congress because I lived in DC. That&rsquo;s changed because of my caregiving responsibilities, so it will be bittersweet on Tuesday when I cast a straight Democratic ballot in Conway, NH.

A territory in the United States with more than 700,000 residents,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> DC has more people than Vermont and Wyoming.

			 <p>American billionaires who intervened in their newspapers' endorsements know that the orange guy is a vindictive prat, unlike Harris. Nonetheless, their actions and Musk&rsquo;s murder of Twitter ought to lead to legislation that limits or undercuts the concentration of media ownership, regardless of who the owners support. We cannot become another oligarchy √† la Autocracy, Inc.</p>
<p>I suspect, though, that this is a fight for another day, if ever. The electorate needs Harris to come through on important bread-and-butter issues first; Harris will need to work coalitions in Congress to increase pressure on Russia&rsquo;s terrorist regime; and on and on.</p>
<p>It seems as if there is always a big and urgent need. So how do we address the fundamentals, including not only media concentration but also campaign finance, gerrymandering, Supreme Court oversight, the Electoral College, a primary system that favors ideological purity over substance, minority rule by those who win only a plurality of votes, and statehood for DC and for any other territories who desire it? Where do we start?</p>
<p>If Republicans were really concerned about media bias, that could form a basis for bipartisan work on media concentration. The past decade or so has shown, however, that they do not want free and fair discussions. Recently, &ldquo;free speech&rdquo; absolutists have given the lie to that notion with Twitter&rsquo;s metamorphosis into X(itter), which followed on the heels of &ldquo;alternative facts&rdquo; and a cultural shift that privileges personal belief over all forms of evidence. Consider, too, the pressure to ban books and not teach darker chapters of our history.</p>
<p>So where or how do we start? Republicans' singular focus on attaining power in the states, in the judiciary, and in the federal government paid off, at least in the short term. They ended Roe; they&rsquo;ve come close to establishing presidential immunity; and they have big plans to blow up most of our remaining institutions. They&rsquo;ve also enabled the blossoming of unregulated militias with freely available assault rifles.</p>
<p>My hope is that enough Americans see through the orange one&rsquo;s grift to put an end to his ambitions for a second term once and for all. I would then like to see Harris appointees hold the worst of the conspiring putschists and domestic terrorists to account in timely fashion so as to delegitimize that kind of opposition. But how do we get from there to a culture that rewards candidates who respect the Constitution and their fellow human beings enough to get the people&rsquo;s work done?</p>

<p>This <em>Puck</em> cartoon from 1880 portrayed immigration in positive terms.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Uncle Sam stands at the entrance to a wooden &ldquo;U.S. Ark of Refuge,&rdquo; a U.S. flag to the side. The image offers a strong contrast to the ramparts Uncle Sam stands at in <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/10/29/the-unrestricted-dumping.html">1903</a> and  behind in <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2019/02/08/walls.html">1916</a>. Beside him is a list of &ldquo;free&rdquo; things offered by &ldquo;U.S.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FREE EDUCATION<br>
FREE LAND<br>
FREE SPEECH<br>
FREE BALLOT<br>
FREE LUNCH.<br>
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉU.S.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The meaning of &ldquo;free&rdquo; varies here. Sometimes it has to do with &ldquo;liberty&rdquo; (free speech and the secret ballot), and other times &ldquo;no cost.&rdquo; If public (&ldquo;free&rdquo;) education is an achievement some in our own time wish to destroy, its existence was bound up with both senses of &ldquo;free.&rdquo; No tuition was required, sure, but it was also a precondition for a free people and for making Americans. &ldquo;Free land&rdquo; in this list would have meant federal lands according to the terms of the various Homestead Acts. But &ldquo;free lunch&rdquo;? What was that about?</p>
<p>This last item was initially a head scratcher for me. I thought it might be a comment or joke about immigrant expectations, but it seems the saying &ldquo;no such thing as a free lunch&rdquo; only gained currency during the middle decades of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch">twentieth-century</a>. In fact, American saloons were offering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_lunch">free lunches</a> at the time of this cartoon, so there really was such a thing for those who liked their beer and whiskey. Given the loads of correspondence and rumors between Europe and the United States, this kind of knowledge would have filtered through, too.</p>
<p>Because saloons are the context of these lunches, it is tempting to gender these free lunches &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; and assume the existence of a social critique of intemperate immigrant men. The image, however, shows heterosexual couples in the prime of life, suggesting that such gendered moralizing was not part of the artist&rsquo;s intention. Moreover, <em>Puck</em> had begun its life as a German-language publication in the previous decade, and the artist-publisher Joseph-Keppler had immigrated from Austria.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Highlighting the list of attractions on the door is the metaphorically clear sky over the &ldquo;ark.&rdquo; Behind the migrants, to the east, are dark storm clouds with black carrion-seeking scavengers in them. The clouds themselves are monsters labeled &ldquo;WAR&rdquo; and &ldquo;DISTRESS.&rdquo; War entailed not only destruction but also <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2017/06/23/war-gender-and.html">mandatory military service</a> of varying terms. Distress, in this context, probably meant economic distress. Europe was in the middle of a long depression, while it was continuing to experience great socio-economic changes in the course of its ongoing industrialization.</p>
<p>Adding more economic and political arguments to the mix, more liberty, a sign in the middle advertises more benefits to life in the United States:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NO OPPRESSIVE TAXES ¬†<br>
NO EXPENSIVE KINGS ¬†<br>
NO COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE<br>
NO KNOUTS [OR] DUNGEONS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cartoon&rsquo;s pairing of dark and light, of the prospects of distress or prosperity, represented what migration discourse in our own time refers to as push and pull factors. Beneath the cartoon is a quote from the <em>N.Y. Statistical Review</em> that highlights the cartoonist&rsquo;s main interest: &ldquo;We may safely say that the present influx of immigration to the United States is something unprecedented in our generation.&rdquo; The detailed cartoon offered a context for this rise.</p>

			 <p>If you&rsquo;re gonna put people on the phone to urge residents to support your candidate, you better make sure they know more than their hastily read script. They should also make clear what organization they&rsquo;re working for, not just what candidate they&rsquo;re supporting. I say &ldquo;working&rdquo;, because I&rsquo;d expect a volunteer to be better informed than the caller was, and the caller sounded more Mid-Atlantic than New England. I guess scaling this kind of effort is never easy. Besides, I only answered because I was curious what local pitch I might hear, but this wasn&rsquo;t that.</p>

Note the mix of genders and ages, including the presence of young children. This was not work that could feed a whole family. No matter the difficult pecuniary circumstances of his subjects, however, Homer portrayed them with dignity.</p>

<p>This color cartoon by Louis Dalrymple appeared in <em>Judge</em> magazine in 1903.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It linked immigration to national security by portraying Italian immigrants in ways that prefigured Trump&rsquo;s despicable, racist rhetoric about &ldquo;bad hombres&rdquo; and pet-eaters in the present presidential race. The federal government, personified here as Uncle Sam, comes off as old and ineffectual.</p>
<p>At least, that&rsquo;s what I see. Here: Old Uncle Sam stands at the ramparts of fortress America, bounded by the sea. The smoke from his pipe forms a wreath to his left. In that appears the late President William McKinley, assassinated in 1901 by the Polish-American anarchist Leon Czolgosz. Uncle Sam has an arm and hand around the flagpole and a cane in the other hand. Rats, monkeys, and other immigrating vermin emerge from the water, clamber up the rampart, and scurry away.</p>
<p>Some of the dehumanized immigrants are armed with a knife or pistol, and they wear a floppy, broad-brimmed hat or a bandana in anarchist red or the Italian tricolor. Their weapons and head apparel read &ldquo;Socialist,&rdquo; &ldquo;Anarchist,&rdquo; &ldquo;Murderer,&rdquo; &ldquo;Assassination,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mafia.&rdquo; More inhuman riffraff falls from a garbage chute marked, &ldquo;Direct from the slums of Europe daily.&rdquo; There is also a cluster of regular gray rats in the harbor.</p>
<p>The message is clear. The immigrants, in this case Italians, are criminal, radical, or just socially undesirable. They are other, vermin, and their presence threatens the country.</p>

Yes, many of us are nervous because of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s interference in 2000, the January 6 debacle, and the work the GOP has been doing to undermine the upcoming election in battleground states. But the bad-faith actors are delusional. They might try some tricks, but most won&rsquo;t stick their necks out. The country will happily embrace a clear result in Harris&rsquo;s favor, as it did for Biden. It will just replace the ageism with sexism and racism.</p>

			 <p>Societies, societal attitudes, and cultural norms change, but people not so much. Positive societal developments reinforce a healthy sense of progress and purpose, but they also trick us into taking too much for granted. Blind to the darkest parts of our own natures, we are caught off guard when the greed, cynicism, hubris, fear, prejudice, and hatred of individuals and mobs assert themselves.</p>
<p>The paradoxical relationship between societal change and human nature can be confounding, but it must not be permitted to immobilize us. There are so many examples of people following their better natures in the final weeks of this electoral fight, so many doing their best to be brave and not despair.</p>

			 <p>Sometimes I wonder how the former reality television star&rsquo;s malevolence, laziness, and insatiable hunger for praise would play out in a second term. What would his version of fascism look like? Anne Applebaum&rsquo;s depiction of Autocracy, Inc. is informative. I also picture competing ideologues, opportunists, and grifters vying for influence and ill-gotten gains.</p>
<p>What I can&rsquo;t imagine is a coherent mass movement to support whatever the orange one&rsquo;s authoritarian instincts manifest. But politicized justice, state violence, mob rule in places, unnecessary suffering by lots of people&hellip; Yes, that is easy to imagine. Incremental, inconsistent, and arbitrary abuses. Loud curfew notices on phones in areas of mass protest. Piss-poor morale in the military&hellip; Ima stop thinking now.</p>

			 <p>A German hashtag phenomenon I ran across on Mastodon and Bluesky recently is #FotoVorschlag (photo suggestion).

Today&rsquo;s was &ldquo;Bach,&rdquo; which is not only the name of a composer but also German for &ldquo;brook&rdquo; or &ldquo;stream.&rdquo; I took the first photo here near Diana&rsquo;s Baths in North Conway and Bartlett, NH, on May 22, 2023. It shows a trail that had been turned into a stream by the rains, which cleared the earth, leaves, and pine needles from the granite.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/09/07/revisiting-image-of.html">Revisiting Image of Two Back Sailors Browsing Books</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/09/07/revisiting-image-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-09-07 09:47:06 -0500">Sep 7, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On August 27th, I posted a mid-to-late 1940s photo of <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/08/27/two-us-navy.html">two Black sailors browsing books in a library section marked &ldquo;Negro Books.&quot;</a> In response, a couple people on my socials expressed outrage or sadness over the segregation they thought they were seeing. That makes sense if one doesn&rsquo;t consider the book titles I mentioned or the link to a related post here titled <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/19/black-librarians-and.html">Reading about Black Librarians and Knowledge Formation</a>.</p>
<p>Thing is, though, books could be powerful wherever librarians made them available in their collections and discoverable by their readers. That&rsquo;s why I see in the image two sailors browsing books in a thematic library display that highlighted a selection of books of probable interest to Black people. The photo&rsquo;s provenance also suggests as much: the U.S. Navy Department&rsquo;s Office of Public Relations produced it, and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture preserved it. What&rsquo;s more, there is the photo&rsquo;s suggestive chronological proximity to the end of the war and to Harry S. Truman&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_9981">desegregation order</a> for the U.S military in 1948. Yes, the photo was taken in a broader context of prejudice and segregation, even atrocity, but the story does not end there.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t allow our knowledge of historical and present-day racism to blind us to signs in the image of people with agency who worked toward a more just world. Someone in the navy&rsquo;s PR office decided or was ordered to take and distribute such a photo, or have this done. One or more people in a navy library ordered and displayed the books that caught the photographer&rsquo;s eye, perhaps owing to the cataloging innovations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_B._Porter">Dorothy B. Porter</a>. Moreover, someone shaped the command climate in which these things transpired.</p>
<p>Whatever led to these particular sailors posing for this picture, the camera recorded two young black men doing something about their present and future. We see them serving their country. We see them acquiring knowledge about it that had emancipatory potential.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing in this kind of framing can negate the history of racism in this country. What thinking about individual agency can do is open our eyes to the humanity and strength of the people who endured and made lives for themselves despite the oppression. The books on the shelves written by Black authors were also evidence of such spirit. And the unknown characters behind the making of this photograph? It is productive to think of them as individuals who made choices within a specific institutional, social, and cultural matrix. Human agency matters.</p>

			 <p>I really enjoyed Peter Pomerantsev, <em><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780571338658">This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War against Reality</a></em> (2019). He pursues his subject across much of the globe, seeking out people who have shaped fractured information spaces in pursuit of their activist or political consulting goals. And he historicizes the development of contemporary information wars and ideological confusion by relating these phenomena to developments during and since the late Cold War.</p>
<p>He lends coherence to the sprawling tale by jumping around places and phenomena in an impressionistic style, using his father&rsquo;s literary and radio biography as a reference point. The father was investigated by the KGB, which led to his family&rsquo;s exile from the Soviet Union. The son later worked in Russian television for nearly a decade, gaining an insider&rsquo;s view of Putin&rsquo;s Russia that turned out to be more broadly relevant than he had initially realized (Pomerantsev, <em><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781610394567">Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible</a></em> [2014]).</p>

			 <p>I am enjoying Depression-era workplace safety posters from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Works Progress Administration<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (WPA). They evoke a time when the power of government was effectively leveraged for good. If you live in the United States, there is a good chance you&rsquo;ve encountered WPA building and infrastructure projects. One WPA program was the Federal Arts Project, which put artists to work. To get a feel for the diversity of programs this art supported, see the Library of Congress&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->online collection<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Besides the four posters that follow this text, I include a photograph of an alley behind a row of houses with tiny back yards in Baltimore. If you look closely at this image from the Farm Security Administration, you can see a WPA poster attached to an open door in the bottom left-hand corner. It is captioned &ldquo;Stop accidents before they stop you.&rdquo; The building itself appears to be part of a factory of some kind because only a door and a single big wall with windows is visible, visually distinct from the opposite side of the alley, where all the little houses are.</p>
<p>These posters remind me of the ongoing importance of government for writing, publicizing, and enforcing workplace safety regulations. They connect past concerns about workplace conditions to countless reports of workplace injuries and sickness in our own time. They also link to family stories past and present, whether handed down or forgotten, whether taught or ignored in schools, workplaces, and union gatherings.</p>
<p>My grandmother&rsquo;s father was killed in an avoidable industrial accident in 1917 when she was six years old. The lathe he operated in a Cleveland factory had no safety guard, and then his luck ran out. He left behind six children and their mother, the oldest of them able to work. The sudden loss of this man represented a trauma that no one talked about in my childhood, and I only learned the barebones details from my mother this past year.</p>
<p>I often wonder if and how such trauma is passed down in other families, and why its causes are silenced or not. My mind goes there because I imagine that millions of Americans‚Äîfrom across the political spectrum‚Äîcome from families with such experiences, even if these were not handed down from the past. And I wonder what, if anything, knowledge about these many pasts might do to change their attitudes today.</p>
<p>This thought ties in with the employers and politicians who fight government regulations and workers' collective bargaining. They strive to steal workers' freedom and dignity, all in the name of their own freedom. Part of this effort benefits from or fosters processes of families and communities forgetting or diminishing the significance of the workplace struggles and traumas in their own pasts.</p>
<p>Fortunately, good governance and organized labor seem to be making a comeback.</p>

			 <p>Michael Bohnert, an engineer at Rand Corporation, shares some useful insights about electronic warfare in the August 16, 2024 episode of the podcast <a href="https://shows.acast.com/ukraine-the-latest">Ukraine the Latest</a>. He discusses this topic in connection with Ukraine&rsquo;s Kursk incursion and describes the difficult choices that Russia&rsquo;s political and military leadership face in the coming months from the standpoint of electronic warfare.</p>
<p>Also, Anders Puck Nielsen, a military analyst in Denmark, released a helpful 15-minute video on YouTube today about where he thinks Russia&rsquo;s leadership is in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_80rUKItGc">responding to Ukraine&rsquo;s incursion</a>. Acknowledging complexity, he nonetheless keeps his viewers' eyes on two fundamental issues for Russia, namely, space and manpower, and he underlines the critical domestic political entanglements that the manpower question has.</p>
<p>Both of these contributions offer useful perspectives on Ukraine&rsquo;s shakeup of a common impression that the conflict was supposedly frozen. Of course, there are many more aspects of this story, but I highlight these contributions because I haven&rsquo;t seen them in other news stories so far.</p>

			 <p>In <em>This is Not Propaganda</em> (end of part 2), Peter Pomerantsev writes of his Russian family, based in Kyiv, becoming stateless in the late 1970s. The KGB had accused his father, Igor, of &ldquo;circulating defamatory fabrications, regular listening to hostile broadcasts and contacts with foreigners.&rdquo; They recommended he emigrate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In many ways Igor was lucky. He had the semblance of choice. The [KGB] major had made it clear that if he stayed, he would have the full seven years in prison and five exiled in the Soviet provinces to face. If he had been a Ukrainian-language poet, [Pomerantsev continues, Igor] would have been locked up immediately. Repression in Ukraine focused on exterminating any signs of independent Ukrainian culture outside the cultural cr√®che of state-sanctioned Soviet &lsquo;Ukrainianness&rsquo;. But Igor wrote in Russian, the language of the coloniser.</p>

			 <p>Lawrence O‚ÄôDonnell had some tough words for his media colleagues yesterday on MSNBC. Journalists pretended to ask questions at a supposed news conference, broadcast live, while Trump pretended he was answering them. Throughout the charade, they gave him and his torrent of semi-coherent lies a pass, like they always do, most fatefully in 2016. Then O&rsquo;Donnell showed a longer segment by the one candidate who actually had something to say yesterday, but whose talk had not been deemed worthy of a live broadcast on any network: Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>The vice president spoke to the United Auto Workers in Detroit. Her message was not a simple repeat of her Philadelphia speech the day before. In this smaller, more focused setting, she talked about the importance of collective bargaining for achieving a fair result. What&rsquo;s more, she tied the term &ldquo;collective&rdquo; as used in an organized labour context to the community theme that figured so prominently in her Philadelphia speech. She linked the hard work of collective bargaining and of organizing politically to love of country, and she spoke of the dignity of labor.</p>
<p>Fairness and dignity. That&rsquo;s a message Americans need to hear about. What they got, instead, was an impotent rehash of the same old resentments, lies, and insecurities. I&rsquo;m not much for television news and opinion, but this 25-minute video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD-oTJ49nls">available on YouTube</a>) is important. Broadcast and print media, take note. Your country deserves better.</p>

			 <p>There are two documentary films streaming on Paramount+ right now that I find inspiring and motivating: &ldquo;Superpower&rdquo; (2023), directed by Sean Penn and Aaron Kaufman; and &ldquo;Kiss the Future&rdquo; (2024), directed by Nenad Cicin-Sain. The first centers on Ukraine and Volodymyr Zelinsky in Russia&rsquo;s current war against Ukraine, and the second goes back to the Siege of Sarajevo (1992‚Äì96).</p>
<p>A theme common to each film is ordinary citizens standing up to genocidal aggressors. There is also the relationship between popular culture and politics in war, including the role of international celebrity. In the first movie, an entertainer-turned-president must lead a country in war, supported by a self-mobilizing citizenry. Moreover, one of the directors is himself an entertainer. In the second movie, inhabitants of a city under constant fire find a way to get by and even thrive with punk rock and dance. They are later joined on TV and then in person by the band U2.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Forms of Delirium&rdquo; is the third act of Peter Pomerantsev, <em>Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia</em> (New York: PublicAffairs, 2014). Now deep in the section titled &ldquo;A Brief History of Sects in Post-Soviet Russia,&rdquo; it dawns on me that this material provides useful context for the bizarre, messianic, wartime rhetoric I&rsquo;ve heard come out of Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov&rsquo;s mouth in the <a href="https://m.youtube.com/@russianmediamonitor" title="Russian Media Monitor on YouTube">television clips</a> that Julia Davis translates for English-speaking audiences.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Solovyov necessarily believes all the poison he spews. The first act of the same book, &ldquo;Reality Show Russia,&rdquo; provides plenty of background on that subject, even if it is based on prewar Russia. Still, the combination of mysticism, religion, ethnic Russian nationalism, and ostensibly anti-imperialist imperialism dripping from parts of the final act of this excellent book offers at least some reason for not dismissing a talking head like Solovyov out of hand. He may use the privilege of the fool to say extreme things, but he knows his words are landing.</p>

			 <p>In a TAZ editorial, Carolina Schwarz observes a recent round of German organizations finally leaving Twitter. She argues that organizations who have been fighting to preserve the space that once was Twitter should <a href="https://taz.de/!6014969/" title="Deutsche Organisationen verlassen X: Haut endlich ab!">give it up</a>. Doing so will render it irrelevant.</p>
<p>I would add that public facing organizations and individuals need to get over their addiction to the misleading follower numbers on xitter (pronounce &ldquo;x&rdquo; with an &ldquo;sh&rdquo; sound) and learn how to navigate and help shape the open social media spaces in the Fediverse and the Fediverse-adjacent Bluesky. Public and publicly funded organizations in particular have a duty to make their communications accessible on open social platforms, even if they want to maintain a presence in the siloed spaces too.</p>
<p>In fact, I no longer bother following institutions, organizations, and publications not on an open social media platform or offering reliable RSS or JSON feeds. There&rsquo;s more than enough to learn in this world without relying on wealthy, would-be gatekeepers of content they did not create.</p>

			 <p>In Thursday&rsquo;s <em>Hareetz</em>, Ofer Aderet offers some <a href="https://archive.ph/gA8Rs">useful background</a> on the exemption of yeshiva students from military service. In 1948, there were only some 400 yeshiva students. Preserving their schools seemed a priority in the wake of the destruction of so much Jewish learning. The exemption was supposed to be temporary, but it still exists. Nowadays, there are more than 60,000 yeshiva students, and the religious and cultural situation of 1948 improved decades ago. Given Israel&rsquo;s current security situation, there is enormous societal pressure to make the burden of mandatory military service equitable. The current government, which includes ultra-Orthodox Jews, has avoided doing so, but the High Court of Justice ruled it has to. John Strawson talks about <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-will-israels-bombshell-court-ruling-that-haredi-jews-must-serve-in-the-military-mean-for-netanyahu-expert-qanda-233460">what this means for Netanyahu</a> in a question-and-answer piece in <em>The Conversation</em>. This second piece assumes less background knowledge on the part of the reader, while also going a bit deeper into the current political context.</p>
<p><em>Links to developments closer to home:</em> Conscription, what Americans call &ldquo;the draft,&rdquo; is a powerful tool for war, but it requires a broad political consensus about the justness of the war and a sense that conscription&rsquo;s implementation is fair. The U.S. Army and its political masters learned this lesson the hard way during the Vietnam War, after which the country moved to a volunteer force. By contrast, the Federal Republic of Germany held onto conscription until 2011 because its political leadership valued the link between military service and citizenship, a liberal tradition with roots in nineteenth-century political, military, and constitutional developments. Conscription is still in the country&rsquo;s Basic Law, but the number of people being called up made conscription inequitable and therefore untenable, at least during a time when a major war in Europe no longer seemed likely.</p>

<p>Air raids were a new danger in the Great War, and people within range of enemy aircraft needed to know what to do. The main caption of this related instructional poster reads, &ldquo;How should I behave during an air raid?&rdquo; Five captioned cartoons in the top row show what <em>not</em> to do. Below each of these is the recommended life-saving response.</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Get away from the window! Curiosity is death!&rdquo; The sketch shows a terror- or awe-stricken family looking out, many mouths wide open. Instead of gawking, the poster commands readers, &ldquo;Stand individually behind pillars!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Never remain standing on an exposed road!&rdquo; &ldquo;Always seek cover!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stand behind the door!&rdquo; This is followed by more advice about strong pillars or load-bearing sections of the wall.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Panic is worse than an air raid!&rdquo; Pictured are people hurrying down the stairs, one person holding a candle, another an oil lamp. Underfoot is a small child who has fallen down, and ahead of these residents is an old man with a cane, about to be trampled. Instead of panicking, the readers are told, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about an attack at night!&rdquo; Pictured is a man under a duvet sleeping soundly.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Never stand in the middle of the room!&rdquo; The picture below this final warning shows a domestic space in which a man in bare feet and a nightshirt has behaved correctly: He is standing in a corner, an empty bed nearby, but the middle of his floor has disappeared.</li>
</ol>
<p>The apparent repetition and contradiction in this anonymously produced poster suggest that the poster was less a product of foresight and more an ad hoc response to recent events or rumors.</p>

			 <p>I found a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020427061139/http://homepage.mac.com/markstoneman">2002 version</a> of my first website on the Wayback Machine. It&rsquo;s a copy they received from the web crawler Alexa Internet. (I don&rsquo;t think I even knew the Internet Archive existed back then.) I wrote the simple HTML, probably with BBEdit Lite, and posted it to the iDisk account I had with Apple. The interesting part about the site for me now is the collection of teaching links I placed on one page. Back then, however, I only indicated its presence with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070104222008/http://homepage.mac.com/markstoneman/links.html">links</a> in a small font size in the footer.</p>
<p>Soon after, I used Dreamweaver to create a more involved website, but not much of that effort has survived. Here&rsquo;s a welcome page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030803044644/http://homepage.mac.com/markstoneman/">from 2003</a> without the CSS and scripts. I didn&rsquo;t keep up the Dreamweaver approach because it was far too involved for my purposes.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080103033202/http://homepage.mac.com/markstoneman/index.html">By 2006</a>, at the latest, it seems I had learned to not use tables, but I have no idea why. After all, touch screen phones were not a thing yet.</p>
<p>Later the site evolved into a wiki, which I produced by simply exporting a VoodooPad wiki to a folder of HTML files using VoodooPad&rsquo;s built-in functionality. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080426211003/http://homepage.mac.com/markstoneman/">version from 2008</a>. Unfortunately, not all of it was archived, and I suspect not all of my VoodooPad files have survived either.</p>
<p>The previous 2008 link leads to a page that lists blogs I have long since <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2012/01/22/another-fresh-start.html">discontinued</a>. The stuff I did on Blogger was not crawled and archived (maybe because Google wasn&rsquo;t sharing its crawling the way Alexa did?). By contrast, some parts of my old WordPress and Tumblr sites seem to have been archived, though usually no more than a couple pages at a time. That said, I already integrated some of those posts into this iteration of my site.</p>
<p>When Apple announced it was closing down iDisk in 2012, I bought my domain and turned one of my WordPress blogs into my main home. Gone was my simple Wiki. VoodooPad never transitioned successfully to iOS anyway, and its new owner has had a hard time keeping up the pace of development. People complain about subscription models, but their absence can lead to the death of beloved apps.</p>
<p>My engagement on Twitter accompanied much of this activity. Some people gave up on blogging completely as a consequence of that platform. l&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Death, destruction, refugeehood, humanitarian crises ‚Äì those are the things we&rsquo;re used to accepting as part of the reality of war&hellip; But in Gaza I also saw the death of the human soul. The Gazans are zombies. Death of souls on that scale, psychological wreckage at that level, I&rsquo;ve never seen anywhere. At a certain point, I went through Rafah, and the streets were filled with refugee tents, and people, and booths, and there were hardly any vehicles, because there&rsquo;s no fuel, so transportation is via carts and donkeys, and people move between them slowly. It took us two hours to cover a distance that normally would take 10 minutes. And all this time I looked at the faces of the people who were passing by us and I was shocked because they just looked dead.</p>

			 <p>The main reason I stuck with Bear.app for many years was the nesting tags feature. But Drafts.app has had that for some time too, so what is the point of Bear for me? The web content saving features aren&rsquo;t for me either because I&rsquo;ve got DEVONthink, which these days plays nicely on my iPad too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve postponed this decision several times because Bear is usually so reliable and easy, but no more. I could live with the recent unnecessary features it was cramming in, but the upgrade to Bear 2 or 2.2 seems to have made it susceptible to crashes. After experiencing that and an unpleasant support interaction, I had one foot out the door. Then I learned that the only regular backup option outside of the practical iCloud syncing was <em>manual</em>. And there was no versioning of individual notes. Both feet out the door now.</p>
<p>One very good thing about Bear is the ease with which one can move data in and out of it.</p>

<p>This is a fascinating short history that references the scholars whose work the cultural reporter draws on.</p>
<p>Teaser: &ldquo;Recent scholarship is uncovering the role of the women who ran libraries during the Harlem Renaissance where they built collections and, just as important, communities of writers and readers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agents of change: The necessary activism required of librarians in oppressive contexts will sound familiar to people today in the context of bans related to race and sexuality. For example, the only significant collection in the Jim Crow South was in Roanoke, Virginia. When the librarian there, Virginia Lee, was eventually told to get rid of the books, she moved them to the basement instead and continued to discretely circulate them.</p>
<p>Knowledge formation: The seemingly banal work of collection, classification, and organization required the creation of new knowledge. For instance, cataloging using the Dewey scheme required the addition of new subjects because that system only foresaw shelving Black-authored and Black-themed books in two limited spaces: under the headings of &ldquo;slavery&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Negro question,&rdquo; the latter a subset of &ldquo;colonization and migration.&rdquo; Dorothy Porter added entirely new categories, including for slave insurrections, the blues, and passing. She also reorganized American political history by situating presidents in topics important to Black readers. Andrew Johnson&rsquo;s tenure was filed under &ldquo;emancipation&rdquo; and Rutherford B. Hayes under &ldquo;Ku Klux Klan&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Knowledge, culture, and sociability: This article has some wonderful photographs, including of the women in groups.</p>
<p>Addendum: The New York Public Library and, within it, The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture have digitized some of their materials. That&rsquo;s where I found a powerful pastel by Morris Schulman titled <a href="https://historyofknowledge.net/2017/09/08/writing-lesson/">&ldquo;The Writing Lesson&rdquo;</a>.</p>

			 <p>I just saw images in <em>The Telegraph</em> of <a href="https://archive.ph/N30QQ">emaciated Ukrainian POWs</a> recently traded back from Russia. These stark images were taken after the men had regained some 10 kilograms of their lost weight. If you look closely, you&rsquo;ll actually see life in the photographed eyes. How did the same eyes and severely weakened bodies look before the exchange?</p>
<p>Starved and no contact with the International Red Cross&mdash;I&rsquo;m trying to grasp what this intentionally extreme mistreatment means. After all, the Ukrainians are holding Russians. As far as I know, food as such is not in short supply in Russia. Was this the result of extreme mistreatment in one location? Or was it more widespread, systematic? Was it about torture with specific mission-related objectives? Was it zeal, resentment, sadism, corruption, indifference? Will this have any impact on Russian POWs in Ukraine? Or will Ukraine&rsquo;s leadership continue striving to keep the higher ground?</p>

<p>Anshel Pfeffer&rsquo;s analysis draws on the time-tested framework of civil-military relations. First and foremost, there is the conflict between the prime minister and his generals. Netanyahu is right to insist on the primacy of civilian political control of the army, but he has apparently never learned the value of taking counsel from his generals. Worse, he is resorting to using a stab-in-the-back conspiracy theory about the generals. People familiar with fascist takeovers will get very uncomfortable with this rhetoric.</p>
<p>Besides the conflict between the civilian and military leadership, there is the army itself, the IDF, whose ranks include conscripts and men and women called back because of their obligations in the reserves. There might be people who escape military service in Israel, but its army is more closely linked to civilian society than any in countries that use all-volunteer professional militaries. That places limits on how irresponsibly it can be used.</p>
<p>Then there is the mess of a war itself. Setting aside the humanitarian crisis and how the atrocities will scar the soldiers called to perpetrate them, there is the prime minister&rsquo;s narrow strategic vision. He and his government know how to order killing, but they have apparently forgotten how asymmetrical warfare works. That, or they think such conflict requires more blood&mdash;an attitude that fits very well with the aggrieved mentalities of stab-in-the-back &ldquo;victims&rdquo; (read: leaders in need of scapegoats to take the blame off themselves). In any case, Amos Harel&rsquo;s focus on certain military details&mdash;from the fighting in Gaza to the growing threat posed by Hezbollah in the north&mdash;reads well with the other article. Taken together, they show a fraught mess largely of Netanyahu&rsquo;s own making.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve started importing photos from my Instagram page to Pixelfed, a Fediverse alternative. The process is still ongoing, but the results look good so far. I skipped comments because moving those out of context doesn&rsquo;t feel right, but the text I originally included with the posts is still there.</p>
<p>I only began using this Instagram account in the pre-vaccination phase of the pandemic. It was after working with Levke Harders on her piece called <a href="https://historyofknowledge.net/2020/09/16/social-media/">&ldquo;Social Media as a Distinct Form of Knowledge Production,&quot;</a> in which she included some discussion about academic Instagram. I wanted to see what was even possible in that context. But it was hard to get into Instagram because of its excessive advertising, suggested posts I never asked for, and follow-spam from scammers. I&rsquo;ve also never loved the absence of an iPad app and third-party app alternatives. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind leaving the place entirely; however, as with Facebook, it&rsquo;s my only connection to some people, especially post-Twitter.</p>
<p>I still share a little there, but only if it&rsquo;s something specific I&rsquo;d like people there to see. Even then, <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/08/visited-facebook-last.html">Meta&rsquo;s algorithm might have other ideas</a>. Instagram makes sharing inconvenient, anyway. It wants you to post there first, whether with its app or its website. Sharing from there to other places is possible, but posting to there from other sources not, unless you&rsquo;re one of their business clients. (Facebook is handled a bit differently, but I&rsquo;ve given up trying to pay attention to Meta&rsquo;s latest gimmicks in human engineering.)</p>
<p>Pixelfed is nice. I&rsquo;m not sure how well it will work as social media for me because I haven&rsquo;t yet been social on it. In any case, it integrates well with Mastodon. I also wonder about the 4 GB storage limit on my instance, Pixelfed.de, but that has to be plenty for the time being. Besides, nothing is locked in the platform or in that instance of the platform. It&rsquo;s the independent web.</p>

<p>I still need to process this report, but its outline already lines up with the reporting presented in the prize-winning Frontline/AP documentary, &ldquo;20 Days in Mariupol&rdquo; (<a href="https://archive.org/details/youtube-gvAyykRvPBo">available in full on the Internet Archive</a>). Its chapters include:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Attacks on Objects Indispensable to the Survival (OIS) of the Civilian Population&rdquo;;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Denial of Humanitarian Aid&rdquo;;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Denial of Humanitarian Evacuations and Filtration&rdquo;; and</li>
<li>&ldquo;Arrest and Persecution of Humanitarian Volunteers.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>At the very least, Russia&rsquo;s systematic actions make one thing even more abundantly clear: Russia&rsquo;s invasion never had anything even remotely to do with &ldquo;protecting&rdquo; Russian speakers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also trying to grasp what Russia&rsquo;s actions mean to Ukrainians already keenly aware of Stalin&rsquo;s instrumentalization of hunger and famine against them.</p>
<p>Finally, it is interesting to see this report come out at a time when Israel&rsquo;s government has been deliberately starving Palestinians in Gaza. There are many past precedents for applying such methods in war, but the international humanitarian movement and international humanitarian law have been making significant strides. Public denials of starvation charges by perpetrators only underline their awareness of this reality.</p>

<p>The author, who has seen much as one of the founders of Human Rights Watch, has long been &ldquo;sparing&rdquo; in his application of the term &ldquo;genocide&rdquo; to state-committed atrocities over the past several decades. Initially he did not think of Israel&rsquo;s indiscriminate, even criminal violence against civilians as genocide, because Israel had a clear right to defend itself against the barbarous acts of Hamas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am now persuaded that Israel is engaged in genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. What has changed my mind is its sustained policy of obstructing the movement of humanitarian assistance into the territory.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What makes this specific article a good read is that he embeds his brief account of the current war into a broad framework of (1) violent conflicts outside of this one, (2) international discourses and agreements about humanity and law in war, and (3) the development of international humanitarian law. Of the last, he writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These efforts, which reflected the growing strength and capacity of the human rights movement, created public awareness of IHL and helped to establish the context in which a conflict such as the war in Gaza is being judged by concerned members of the public worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neier ends the piece with the establishment of courts to prosecute war crimes and crimes against international humanitarian law. He very briefly considers their relevance to the war in Gaza. Of course, Netanyahu cares little about international opinion or rules. The prime minister invokes &ldquo;antisemitism&rdquo; because it suits his current objectives.</p>
<p>Working against his methods is another fact that world leaders ignore at their own peril, it seems to me. As Neier writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been engaged in efforts to protect human rights for more than six decades, often in circumstances with exceedingly high stakes. I cannot recall any dispute over rights that aroused greater passions and more debate than that involving the war in Gaza since October 7.</p>

<p>Question: How are universities governed in Israel? How vulnerable are they to outside political pressure under less fraught conditions?

		<a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/14/tiny-theme-use.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-06-14 18:06:57 -0500">Jun 14, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The transition from Wordpress.com to Micro.blog was challenging because of the initial difficulty I had in finding and customizing a theme that worked for me. They either did not feel right to me, or I couldn&rsquo;t find sufficient documentation. This problem was multiplied by insufficient knowledge about Hugo (the blogging software) and Go (the language Hugo uses).</p>
<p>I initially passed over Tiny Theme because I did not appreciate its developer&rsquo;s approach, but pouring through the Micro.blog help forums led me to try it again. Armed with a little more knowledge, I began to appreciate what the theme offers.</p>
<p>Tiny Theme is the best-documented theme on Micro.blog. Besides the <a href="https://github.com/MattSLangford/Tiny-Theme-for-Micro.blog">Git page</a>, its creator, <a href="https://mattlangford.com">Matt Langford</a> has a dedicated <a href="https://tiny.micro.blog">Tiny Theme site</a>, written in plain language that assumes some knowledge of blogging and markup, but not overly much.</p>
<p>Matt also generously answers questions, but do your research first&mdash;both as a common courtesy and so you understand his answers.</p>
<p>I think his &ldquo;leave a tip link&rdquo; recalls the great tradition of shareware, which Apple&rsquo;s app store has undermined in the MacOS world. Why not honor his work and keep such a tradition alive at the same time?</p>
<h3 id="future-proofing">Future-Proofing</h3>
<p>The theme is built to be adaptable without changes requiring too many interventions in its core templates. One can still edit those, but Matt wrote the templates to look for a user&rsquo;s customizations in files called microhooks. This makes updating the theme much easier.</p>
<p>Update-proofing matters because Matt regularly maintains and updates the theme (in useful ways, not ways that require you to rethink everything).</p>
<p>In this respect, it is better to use your Micro.blog custom CSS page than to change the theme&rsquo;s CSS directly.</p>
<p>This last point about CSS is critical for making a move to another theme possible. A lot of CSS customizations are specific to a theme, but you have some that are not theme-specific, e.g., <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/12/small-image-galleries.html">small image galleries</a>.</p>
<p>If you customize one of the theme&rsquo;s core templates (as opposed to the microhooks you write from scratch), write down what you did. You will need this information later. See below for your own customizations.</p>
<h3 id="updating-tiny-theme">Updating Tiny Theme</h3>
<p>‚ö†Ô∏è When you see an update is available in Micro.blog&rsquo;s plugins UI (where the themes are stored), do not hit the update button. Instead, first go to Github to see which files have changed. (It&rsquo;s an easier UI for scanning modification dates.) Make a note of their names. Then hit the update button in the pugins UI.</p>
<p>‚õîÔ∏è Never click the üîÑ button on the Micro.blog theme management page. Despite its emoji, it does <strong>not</strong> sync your files. It just downloads from the Github repository and overwrites your customized files, except the microhooks. You don&rsquo;t need this functionality,</p>
<p>After that, your theme files in Micro.blog&rsquo;s theme editing UI (menu item: Design) will all still be intact. Below that section are the unedited theme files. If you have modified any of the files that that were updated, see the next step. Otherwise you&rsquo;re done (except to eyeball your blog for any apparent issues).</p>
<p>Assuming you have taken notes on your modifications to any of the theme&rsquo;s templates that were updated, you first delete these modified files from the customization section, and then you modify and save the same changes in the section that holds the themes unmodified files. As soon as you do that, Micro.blog saves the file you your customized templates and restores the original template to the theme files section.</p>
<p>This setup relates to the lookup order of Micro.blog&rsquo;s Hugo rendering engine: It first looks if the necessary template is among the customized files. If it finds it, that&rsquo;s the one it uses to output that (part of the) page . If not, it looks to the original theme files. (If here either, it looks to Micro.blog&rsquo;s default files.)</p>
<h3 id="my-modifications">My Modifications</h3>
<p>This section does not include the microhooks, since the theme doesn&rsquo;t touch their contents.</p>
<h4 id="layouts_defaultlisthtml">layouts/_default/list.html</h4>
<p>This file renders category pages on Micro.blog. I merely added &ldquo;Category: &quot; before the page title (the category name) in the following block.</p>
<p><code>&lt;h2 class=&quot;p-name&quot;&gt;Category: {{ .Title }}&lt;/h2&gt;</code></p>
<h4 id="layouts_defaultlistarchivehtmlhtml">layouts/_default/list.archivehtml.html</h4>
<p>This is the template renders the archive page on Micro.blog, if you have enabled the page in Micro.blog&rsquo;s UI.</p>
<p>Main issues with Tiny Theme default:</p>
<ol>
<li>The categories are not alphabetized.</li>
<li>The categories render as a long vertical list.</li>
</ol>
<p>I needed alphabetical order and a format that worked better for all my categories than a vertical unordered list. (I have a lot of categories because Micro.blog is only set up for categories, not categories and tags.)</p>
<p>Tiny Theme has a microhook to add introductory material to the archive page, so that bit is not at issue here.</p>

<p>I was able to get most of the following by copying and pasting from a file in the notes of a short YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un4vw1QscsY">video by Vlad Campos</a>.

			 <h3 id="my-history-with-wordpresscom">My history with WordPress.com</h3>
<ul>
<li>Began with free version, ca. 2007; was an improvement over Blogger (by then owned by Google).</li>
<li>Ads become too obtrusive, so paid to remove them.</li>
<li>Began using site not only to blog, but also as a professional signboard.</li>
<li>Eventually upgraded to business plan to meet customization needs (add plugins).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Made site usable for course materials (behind password) because setting up courses on Blackboard was crazy time-consuming, especially for an adjunct professor who couldn&rsquo;t get into any routine. (And Blackboard was unreliable.)
<ul>
<li>Continued to use site for blog and professional signboard. Expensive, but support always available via chat. Well worth it, especially now that I had a regular salary (editor, GHI).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Switch to freelance in 2020 required a whole new set up. I accomplished this by modifying one of their templates.</li>
<li>Within about 18 months, this site broke. WordPress.com declared the theme I was using deprecated &ndash; with no warning.</li>
<li>Started over, but stayed on WordPress.com because of my elder care responsibilities (my father&rsquo;s last several months alive).</li>
<li>WordPress.com all in on its block themed UI, so I  did it that way. Took a lot of extra work, and a new issue arose: page load times.
<ul>
<li>Search engine rankings were now taking these into account, and these block themes seemed to be monsters. Extensions needed to optimize images, CSS, scripts.</li>
<li>Automattic&rsquo;s Jetpack CDN was not all that fast. Needed to add Cloudflare to the mix for that and more control over caching.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Such a setup required constant attention, and WordPress.com&rsquo;s online customer support degraded: longer wait times, maybe no chat at all, longer email response times, if such were needed, and so on. To add insult to injury, they started selling expensive website optimization add-ons for problems they themselves were creating.</li>
<li>Before I let the site renew, I looked for a system that produced static pages because they load faster than a dynamic platform like WordPress, which builds pages on the fly.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be possible to render static pages on my own computer with Hugo (or related) and then host these pages on Github or Cloudflare. Assuming modest traffic, this might even be free. But the learning curve. Hugo is powerful, but it&rsquo;s command-line only. I didn&rsquo;t have time before my other set-up had expired. Command line is doable for simpler tasks, but I&rsquo;ve found that tools like these are generally written for others already at home in this environment. The documentation tends to have a high bar of entry.</p>
<h3 id="choosing-microblog">Choosing Micro.blog</h3>
<ul>
<li>Micro.blog, which uses the Hugo engine, started to look attractive. Its web UI is quirky; its documentation is incomplete; and its Mac and iOS apps don&rsquo;t offer feature parity. Its underlying ethos, however, works for me: It wants average users to be able to work with its tools. At the same time, it offers ways to customize things, even if these options tend to presuppose a lot more prior knowledge.</li>
<li>Micro.blog is definitely not as easy as Blogger and WordPress were in the aughts, if you need to customize things. Once you get things running, though, you can write in Markdown, which humans can easily write and read. It&rsquo;s easy to post from any computer or mobile device, including my phone. (WordPress had made that increasingly difficult.)</li>
<li>Micro.blog has its own social network, which I was not interested in, especially not in the wake of Twitter&rsquo;s murder and the ensuing platform fatigue (and I had come to Twitter after another platform imploded). But Micro.blog&rsquo;s network and the blogs it hosts are built so one can participate in the IndieWeb. One can pull one&rsquo;s content from elsewhere, syndicate the content of one&rsquo;s hosted blog, and so on. Even some replies can travel beyond a single platform or website.</li>
<li>There has been a learning curve for me, but it has solved not only my blog-hosting problem, but also offered me additional <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2023/09/19/juggling-social-media.html%20title=%22Juggling%20Social%20Media%20Platforms%22">options in this post-twitter world</a>.</li>
<li>Given the Fediverse context (which decentralizes comment moderation and involves many more people in the process, in relative terms), I&rsquo;ve even felt able to <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/03/comments-back-on.html">turn comments back on</a></li>
<li>And I&rsquo;ve seen the point of bringing back a <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/02/bringing-back-a.html">blogroll</a>.</li>
<li>Bonus point: there hasn&rsquo;t been any need to set up GDPR cookie notices, which were very necessary on WordPress.com (a self-hosted WordPress blog can be privacy friendlier, provided you have the know-how). I still need a <a href="https://markstoneman.com/privacy-notice/">privacy notice</a>, but it&rsquo;s much simpler now, especially since I also removed YouTube embeds.</li>

			 <p>The following post appeared in my Mastodon timeline this morning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of today, MacStories is disallowing all known AI crawlers, including ChatGPT and Applebot. If you want to read our site, you should use a web browser or RSS.<br>
‚úåÔ∏è<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/112609519691842609">Federico Viticci, June 13, 2023</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pronouncement could, indeed, <em>is</em> being made by countless others who run independent websites. Questions and anxiety abound, but we are nowhere close to fashioning responses adequate to the current moment. A visceral sense of violation, of wrong, is hitting many of us, who have long since had enough of Silicon Valley, Madison Avenue, and all the rest treating the traces we leave online as a natural resource to extract value from. Yesterday, the above-quoted observer on Mastodon <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/112606317077490324#">reported</a>, &ldquo;I was grossed out when I read that Applebot scraped &lsquo;the open web&rsquo; to train their AI model&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>My most immediate question about his no-AIs-on-MacStories statement was <em>how?</em> How you are working to keep <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLMs</a> from feasting on your site? Take the robots.txt file: Are there settings that allow search engines to index pages while instructing those same search engines that their LLM activities are not welcome? How do you cover all known LLMs and related scraping activities in a meaningful way? Aren&rsquo;t these things and their user numbers multiplying and mutating in ways that exceed our individual tracking abilities, not to mention <a href="https://www.searchenginecodex.com/proposing-a-new-meta-tag-for-llm-ai/" title="Dena Mason, 'Proposing A New Meta Tag For LLM/AI'">the limits</a> of what a robots.txt file can hold?</p>
<p>Alternatively, have you found a way to make copyright and licensing statements that these tools will understand and honor? I&rsquo;m trying meta tags, but I think only the first of the two below is standard:</p>
<p><code>&lt;meta name=&quot;author&quot; content=&quot;Mark R. Stoneman&quot;&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;meta name=&quot;license&quot; content=&quot;CC BY-NC-SA 4.0&quot;&gt;</code></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also using semantic tags to ensure my copyright and CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license statements in the footer are easily discoverable, but it all feels so provisional, so early-2000s-wild-west again. Only worse.</p>
<p>Moreover, the LLM challenge reaches beyond simple illegal copying, downloading, storage, and retrieval. These LLMs are being trained on our words, trained, it almost seems, by lurking in our conversations and learning. Their value proposition is that they will build something new on the basis of what already exists. Although this feels purely extractive (like Elsevier&rsquo;s contribution to academic publishing), how can such direct links between our individual output and that of the LLMs be established?</p>
<p>Perhaps we are mixing feelings and concepts in ways that do not necessarily apply to the current situation. To begin with, there is that sense of personal violation that many of us have long felt with respect to the trackers that Google and other marketing entities use without our permission. The European Union&rsquo;s <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">GDPR</a> is meant to address that problem for its citizenry, but the phenomenon of LLMs training on our language does not necessarily amount to an infringement of our data privacy&mdash;not if they are &ldquo;learning&rdquo; how to &ldquo;listen&rdquo; and &ldquo;talk&rdquo;, but not retaining data on our personal habits for later use. At the same time, this LLM scraping feels even creepier and more extractive than what advertising trackers were doing in the pre&ndash;LLM era.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to imagine how we can regain a sense of control over the things we publish on the internet. We need practical web standards and tools that give us choices that the big LLM players are willing to respect. We need metaphors that reach beyond copyright and privacy, when necessary, but that don&rsquo;t lead us to anthropomorphize the LLMs and their &ldquo;learning&rdquo;, thereby making the problem of so-called AI even worse. And we need jurisprudence that looks for ways to deal with our sense of violation that privacy laws and copyright alone do not seem adequate for. Meanwhile companies that use our linguistic existences to sell language-based LLM services back to us would do well to listen to their critics and adjust their activities accordingly. Wrapping up everything in pretty privacy policies and new feature hype will not be enough for them to thrive, although their deep pockets will help buy the legal frameworks they want, if we&rsquo;re not paying attention.</p>

		<a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/11/digital-gardens.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-06-11 20:32:15 -0500">Jun 11, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I ran into the term &ldquo;digital gardens&rdquo; on the ü¶£  profile of <a href="https://pkm.social/@RDK">@RDK@pkm.social</a>, which I looked up because of a repost by <a href="https://indieapps.space/@drafts">@drafts@indieapps.space</a> of a piece on the latter&rsquo;s search functionality. RDK&rsquo;s whole website, <a href="https://justtext.net/">Just Text</a>, has a quirky feel that reminds me of some Micro.blog-hosted blogs. These have extra pages about stuff that matters to them, lists, photos, a Tweet archive, other collections of related content.</p>
<p>I did a web search and started with <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/">&ldquo;Digital gardens let you cultivate your own little bit of the internet&rdquo;</a> (short). And then <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">&ldquo;A Brief History &amp; Ethos of the Digital Garden -&quot;</a>(detailed, thoughtful) by Maggie Appleton. The approach draws a contrast to (micro)blogging, and in some cases might take the form of a wiki, as in <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/">Tom Critchlow. Move. Think. Create.</a></p>
<p>This last one reminds me of my early course websites and source reference pages. At some point in the early aughts, I produced everything on VoodooPad (MacOS) and simply exported it into static html files. These I uploaded to whatever cloud-sharing service Apple offered its users before iCloud. The personal wikis also make me think about readings I did later for an unfinished project,
<a href="https://markstoneman.com/2017/06/23/war-gender-and.html">&ldquo;War, Gender, and Nation in 19th-Century Europe&rdquo;</a>. All my notes were in an iOS wiki made with an app that is no longer available. I hope my export of that file survived my various digital moves since then.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there has to be a dichotomy between timelines and other forms of independent webby existence.  I believe in my war and gender project, I not only interlinked reading notes and topic pages but also a research journal. I need that chronology too because I learn that way. This last point became clear again this past month while moving web hosts and redoing my categories. Revisiting the old has me making connections and gaining insights.</p>
<p>But I also need communication, and I like the Indie Web&rsquo;s general outlook on that. References: indieweb.org, book.micro.blog.</p>
<p>A common theme in these various approaches to the web seems to be <em>intentionality</em>. Many of us practiced more of that in 2020‚Äì2021, during the worst of the pandemic. I find myself in need of that now, too, because of the major disruptions that continue to affect my life.</p>
<p>Possibly related: yesterday I was thinking that my <a href="https://markstoneman.com/portfolio/">portfolio</a>, organized for others, could also be accessed through short, related blog posts. Maybe the bridge could be this notes format.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t cross-post notes pages to any social accounts, unless one is relevant to a particular discussion.</p>
<p>Addition: I just ran across the website of Sarah Shotts via a query on Micro.blog&rsquo;s forum. Their <a href="https://www.sarahshotts.com/log">Artist&rsquo;s Log</a> page is subtitled &ldquo;A Commonplace Book and Curiosity Cabinet of My Creative Ecosystem.&rdquo; What a wonderful way to put it. This log is a menu item on a site that presents the artist&rsquo;s portfolio, books, and bio to the world.</p>

<p>Von Schock und √úberraschung nach den gestrigen Wahlergebnissen lese ich auf Mastodon. Wirklich aber? Es gab ja in Deutschland das Ganze mit dem Kampf gegen die n√∂tige Machtaus√ºbung des Staates w√§hrend der schlimmsten Momente der Pandemie. Mangelndes Mitgef√ºhl hat das schon gezeigt, und grosse Vertrauensverlust den Machtaus√ºbenden gegen√ºber. Vielleicht triftiger noch: wir in den USA kennen eine starke Affinit√§t zwischen solchen Ansichten und rechtspopulistischem bzw. rechtsradikalem Gedankengut. Ich meine, da√ü diesen Zusammenhang √∂fters in Deutschland auch konstatiert wurde.</p>
<p>Ich denke auch etwa an 2015 und an &ndash; anders aber relevant &ndash; die schlimmen Angriffe auf ausl√§ndische Mitb√ºrger kurz nach der Wende. Neuerdings gab us wieder das instinktive Weiterr√ºcken der CDU/CSU F√ºhrung nach rechts, was ja nicht im Vakuum geschieht. Zu guter Letzt gibt es die R√ºckgratlosigkeit des Bundeskanzlers und einer Gro√üzahl anderer Politiker, die die √∂ffentliche Meinung lieber folgen als lenken zu versuchen. Mich sollte es eher √ºberraschen, da√ü es √úberraschung gibt, aber das kenn ich in den USA auch, wie viel vom vorher Erw√§hntem auch.</p>
<p>Es gibt zwei ber√ºhmten schwarzen Komiker hierzulande, die in einem Sketch nach der Wahl 2016 nur lachen konnten, weil sie sehr wohl wu√üten, dass der Rassismus weiterhin fluorierte. Wenn man Peacock in den USA hat, ist es wohl leicht zu finden.

			 <p>Max Boot on Threads <a href="https://www.threads.net/@maxboot/post/C762T_5uH_c">writes</a>, &ldquo;I really want Threads to take over from X which is broken. But this is discouraging.&rdquo; Setting aside the fact that he has 23,000 followers, I typed a hurried response because I just can&rsquo;t hear it anymore. Why do so many smart, media-savvy people refuse to understand what has happened in the social media space over the past two years? Maybe it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ve always understood Twitter as just another broadcast medium?</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mark.stoneman/post/C7-k8KJOac2">my reply</a> as is, warts and all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe people accustomed to huge followings need to rethink how they do social media. The days of one platform are gone. A lot of us you will want to reach will never be reachable on twitter. And many of us will not stay on threads if it does not actually federate or stop playing around with its algorithm in such an unhelpful way. Try Bluesky, and try encouraging people to set up algorithms that will discover news. Try setting up such algorithms yourself and spreading the word about them. 1/2</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Use tools that let you broadcast to multiple platforms. But also, stop thinking of such media as broadcast media. Go for quality interactions too. Doing so can have its own network effects. Besides, shouldn&rsquo;t your media organizations be setting up tools too, such as their own Mastodon instances, Bluesky algorithms for your benefit, etc. There will never again be a pre-Musk Twitter. And we need to stop relying on the mega rich to build our tools. 2/2</p>

			 <p>The IndieWeb approach is about owning your own content.

			 <p>I am wondering how Threads can really federate given what Meta is doing with user content and so-called AI. There&rsquo;s opt-out in Europe and no choice whatsoever in the United States. While both situations are bad, they are becoming known. But what about people on other Fediverse instances who casually interact with a Threads account? I wonder who&rsquo;s working harder right now to achieve federation, Threads' coders, their legal team, or their spin doctors? The doublespeak, selective listening, and tone-deafness in Adam Mosseri&rsquo;s posts are sometimes hard to overlook.</p>

<p>This also works in reverse. Bluesky ü¶ã accounts can build a bridge to Mastodon and other Fediverse accounts by following <code>@ap.brid.gy</code>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how I&rsquo;ll use this, given that I have an account in both places, but it should make certain kinds of cross-sharing easier. By reposting something on one platform, I&rsquo;ll have it on the other, where I can repost from my primary account on that platform.</p>
<p>Regardless, Bridgy Fed&rsquo;s real power probably lies in the access it gives to (potential) readers who favor one platform over the other.

			 <p>I just noticed that the <a href="/portfolio/history-of-knowledge-blogs/">History of Knowledge</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;About&rdquo; page has been rewritten to claim that the GHI&rsquo;s director conceived that project. I would tell the story somewhat differently, but the boss gets to tell the story the way she wants.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Besides, this version reinforces my impression that my co-editor and I did something good because this boss would never claim ownership of a dud.</p>
<p>In fact, the site is still thriving, and, remarkably, it&rsquo;s chugging along with the same old Penscratch theme from WordPress&rsquo;s pre&ndash;block theme era. In an academic culture focused on making the new, while ignoring the need to maintain what has already been built, this is also a win of sorts. And I rest easier knowing that the site is being regularly archived by the Wayback Machine. Regardless of a director&rsquo;s priorities and the institute&rsquo;s funding, this thing will continue to exist for quite a while.</p>
<p>I just wish the current team had a more modern understanding of social media. Staying on Twitter after 2022 has meant relegating any conversation with readers and contributors to a now siloed platform that countless scholars and concerned citizens have abandoned. Of course, this criticism presupposes a desire for conversation. I suspect, though, that social media is purely a broadcast medium for the current team, as it is for many organizations. After all, engagement takes time, which means financial and opportunity costs.</p>

			 <p>I activated a <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2024/06/02/bringing-back-a.html" title="The first was a blogroll.">second feature</a> on my Micro.blog-hosted site that I had turned off years ago while still on WordPress: Comments. They had become more trouble than they were worth, and there was always the once useful bird site, where real conversations could transpire. But those were different times.</p>
<p>In a moment of optimism, I have chosen to believe that the sign-in requirement with Mastodon, BluSky, or Micro.blog will reduce potential friction for me because I&rsquo;ve encountered a lot less of it on these federating platforms. But time will tell. Right now, I can unmark a problematic comment so it doesn&rsquo;t appear, but only after the comment is initially posted. (The developer behind Micro.blog is considering making prior-approval an option.) I also have the usual mute, block, and report options.</p>
<p>Next step: seeing what happens&mdash;and what I might still need to do&mdash;if I get any responses from other sites via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention">webmention</a>. I&rsquo;m definitely enjoying what the IndieWeb community makes possible, but I wish its tools and documentation were more accessible to non-programming folk. I can deal with modern HTML and CSS, but that&rsquo;s as far as it goes.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since I maintained a blogroll, but the poisoning of Twitter makes me think it&rsquo;s a good idea. I do not want my network to be owned by a random billionaire whose interests are at odds with community building and maintenance. I&rsquo;ve been slowly (re)connecting with people on other microblogging platforms, but it&rsquo;s time to begin making my own site social as well. That&rsquo;s why the <a href="/blogroll">blogroll</a> is back.</p>
<p>A couple first impressions: I&rsquo;m noticing fewer blogs among people I&rsquo;m following on Mastodon than I would have expected on Twitter some fifteen years ago, when microblogging was not yet so ubiquitous. There are plenty of websites as CVs and marketing tools (for books and speaking engagements), but not as many blogs per se. On the other hand, there is a ton of microblogging going on. It&rsquo;s possible that some of these accounts should find their way onto my blogroll&mdash;perhaps more personal blogs too. But baby steps.</p>
<p>For now, I want to curate a list that reflects the interests on display in my own blogging. This approach will not necessarily create social connections with those I list, but it should manifest socially contingent knowledge about other blogs that some readers might find useful. In other words, I&rsquo;m trying to offer some social or human-driven discovery as opposed to the stuff that algorithmically driven search engines and social media deliver.</p>

			 <p>I quit the old bird site <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2022/12/04/bye-bye-birdie/" title="Bye Bye Birdie">last December</a>, and I&rsquo;ve been a happy <a href="https://zirk.us/@markstoneman">Mastodon</a> user instead ever since. Nonetheless, I&rsquo;ve recently begun dalliances with <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mark.stoneman">Threads</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/markstoneman.com">Bluesky</a>. I&rsquo;m not looking for greener pastures, but I&rsquo;m curious about what&rsquo;s on offer now, and I want to find some of the people who I don&rsquo;t see on Mastodon. Juggling social media platforms is inconvenient, but seemingly unavoidable at this particular moment, as people search for new communities and rebuild parts of their old ones. It is a moment of flux, and such flux could very well be the new normal.</p>
<h3 id="the-twitter-that-was">The Twitter that Was</h3>
<p>Among the growing circles of people who have quit the place once called Twitter, discussions about the new platforms tend to occur in reference to the old place, if only implicitly. But characterizing that old place is not as straightforward as one might think. Before the recent ill-considered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/07/musk-rushes-out-new-twitter-logo-its-just-an-x-that-someone-tweeted-at-him/" title="Musk rushes out new Twitter logo‚Äîit‚Äôs just an X that someone tweeted at him">rebranding</a> to X, Twitter was already different things to different people, depending not only on individual preferences but also on Twitter&rsquo;s possibilities. Those changed a great deal over the platform&rsquo;s first fifteen years, evolving in a synergy between users and developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag">Hashtags</a> were first employed by users as a way to organize and find posts. They also became tools for community-building. (Katrina Gulliver started using #twitterstorians back when historians' numbers there were relatively modest, for example, and this enabled us to find each other.) Quote tweets arose from user efforts to editorialize about others' posts. And threads, multipart tweets known earlier as tweetstorms, helped make such bursts of text easier to read in the order intended by the author. As Twitter adopted or initiated such features, they assumed different roles in users' practices and expectations, depending not only on users' needs and preferences but also on when they first adopted Twitter.</p>
<p>In the early days, independent developers improved the Twitter experience with third-party mobile and desktop applications that offered features Twitter did not, or they implemented functionalities differently. It was also possible to follow what was happening by using an older internet protocol called RSS, the same thing one can still use to follow blogs and other sites in a newsreader (I use <a href="https://netnewswire.com" title="A free open-source Mac and iOS app">NetNewsWire</a>). And services emerged to let one stitch a series of posts into a single story. Blogging and other content management systems worked out ways to integrate users' activities with Twitter, and automation services such as IFTTT and Zapier made it possible to set up recipes that were triggered in the event of certain content. One could use a specific hashtag in a tweet, and that hashtag would trigger an IFTTT recipe to post the same thing on Facebook. There were also bots, little applications that could pull data from somewhere, including Twitter, and post to Twitter themselves, acting openly as bots or masquerading as real people. Coders created bots for fun and bots for good, but also bots that served grifters and the spread of disinformation.</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s open <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a> made this diverse range of activity and user experiences possible. Its now prohibitively priced API has meant the death of most third-party applications and services.</p>
<p>As people leave xitter, they are searching for different things and reacting to other platforms accordingly. They are first and foremost looking for people from their old network. But they are also looking for specific features, the kind that can help them to approximate their earlier experiences, or even improve on them.</p>
<h3 id="the-apps-i-use">The Apps I Use</h3>
<p>In my case, a crucial aspect of the features question is how well each platform dovetails with my established routines on the iPad and Mac. Specifically, I am interested in integration with third-party apps and services for composition, crossposting, and syndication. I also want good apps for the specific social media platforms I&rsquo;m on. And I want a choice in the matter, like I used to have with Twitter before Musk started to reshape his newly purchased realm into a walled-off dystopia.</p>
<p>I have come to like Mastodon so much in part because <a href="https://tapbots.com">Tapbots</a> was so fast to release and refine a Mastodon client called <strong>Ivory</strong> (iOS and Mac). Having used this small company‚Äôs excellent <a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> for at least a decade, I felt at home in Ivory right away, much more so than in the other Mastodon apps I tried.</p>
<p>Another helpful app that I have used for many years is <strong>Linky</strong> by <a href="https://pragmaticcode.com">Pragmatic Code</a>. An iOS app that is available through the system&rsquo;s share extension from within Safari, it lets me post a link and select the accompanying image or images I want. Adding <a href="https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/describe-content-images">alt text</a> to each image for those who use a <a href="https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-products/screen-readers">screen reader</a> is also easy. So is creating an image from selected text (a text shot) with the same text added automatically to the alt text. Linky works with other browsers too, but not for text shot creation.</p>
<p>In the old days, before Facebook sealed its platform off from third-party clients, I could post to the bird and face sites at the same time with Linky. Nowadays, we&rsquo;re down to Mastodon, although a beta release this month has added <a href="https://mastodon.social/@pragmaticcode/111001659389734215">support for Bluesky</a>. Threads support is currently not on the table because there is no public API for developers to work with.</p>
<p>Another iOS and Mac app that I have long used with social media is <strong><a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a></strong> by Agile Tortoise. Besides being a really good input device that makes working with text a breeze on a mobile device, it has all manner of actions to automate moving one&rsquo;s text to other apps. Using the system share menu, it is possible to move text anywhere, but its ability to post directly to a platform is currently limited to Mastodon.</p>
<p>I use three Mastodon actions in Drafts: one to post directly, one to post a thread of multiple numbered posts with a single click, and one that opens the post in an Ivory draft (handy for adding images and accompanying alt text). There are many more actions available, too, because Drafts has an active userbase that contributes to the actions in its <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com" title="Drafts Directory">directory</a>. In fact, if you know how to write scripts, you could probably create an action that posts directly to Bluesky because that platform, like Mastodon, is open-source, albeit with a different, less mature internet protocol.</p>
<h3 id="diversity-of-platforms">Diversity of Platforms</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s still early days in this post-xitter world, so I&rsquo;ll talk about the kinds of people I&rsquo;m finding and interactions I&rsquo;m having another time. Only one thing is already clear: Many of the academics I used to follow are happy with Mastodon, but they don&rsquo;t necessarily use the same tools I do. Many others are still hopping about, trying the different places, and sometimes even keeping xitter in the mix. Based on the behavior and comments I&rsquo;m seeing, I suspect there will no longer be a single, one-size-fits-all-in-countless-different-ways platform of the kind the old bird place had become. I&rsquo;m resigned to using more than one social media venue, as different people find the social media platforms that suit them best.</p>
<p>Besides, there must be people out there working on ways to read and post on multiple platforms from within the same application. It&rsquo;s too bad some social networking platforms will remain closed to such efforts, but I hope openness and some amount of interoperability is where the winds are blowing, at least outside of xitter. If Threads adds support for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23689570/activitypub-protocol-standard-social-network">ActivityPub</a> (the protocol that Mastodon uses), as Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/introducing-threads-new-app-text-sharing/">announced</a> it would, that would send a powerful signal to commercial social networks, despite Meta&rsquo;s record of locking people inside Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>Openness and interoperability ought to be goals we can agree on. Imagine if your email provider didn&rsquo;t let you communicate with people outside their service. Imagine them holding your contacts hostage if you changed services. What about not being able to choose how you read your email, that is, with which app or web interface? Avoiding that kind of nonsense is a major promise of Mastodon and the other kinds of software that use ActivityPub.</p>

			 <p>Driving north on Rt. 16, I can still be surprised by the appearance of the White Mountains from a few hilltops between Wakefield and Ossipee. For a moment, today, I was even treated to Mt. Chocorua and Mt. Washington as the dominant figures in a stunning pattern of silhouettes that rose into the late afternoon sky. Chocorua was front and center, and Washington rose up behind it in a pairing that is impossible to imagine in Chocorua&rsquo;s shadow, where I grew up, let alone in Mt.

			 <p>In the past, I rarely watched YouTube, but the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bird site&rsquo;s corruption<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has seen me on YouTube much more often, as I search for content about Ukraine. Recently I found a good Ukrainian-made series about how Ukrainians in various kinds of media have adapted to Russia&rsquo;s full-scale invasion. There are 10 episodes, not counting a 3-minute trailer. All but the last are about 15 minutes long, and the final one is 25 minutes. (I&rsquo;ve seen half of them so far.) The series is largely in Ukrainian with English subtitles, and partly in English with Ukrainian subtitles, depending on who is speaking. The titles on YouTube are in Ukrainian, but there&rsquo;s a playlist that has them all in the correct order. Besides, you don&rsquo;t need to know the Cyrillic alphabet to read the episode numbers (—î–ø—ñ–∑–æ–¥ 1, 2, 3 ‚Ä¶) of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Media at War&rdquo; (–ú–µ–¥—ñ–∞ –Ω–∞ –≤—ñ–π–Ω—ñ)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and to watch Ukrainians speak for themselves.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>My last post was of snow and now August is almost over? Yikes!</p>
<p>After commuting thousands of miles between DC and New Hampshire since my <a href="%5Bmarkstoneman.com/2022/07/1...%5D(https://markstoneman.com/2022/07/15/to-everything-there-is-a-season/)" title="To Everything There Is a Season">father&rsquo;s passing</a>, I&rsquo;ve spent the summer in New Hampshire. The marathon driving sessions wear on me, so I&rsquo;ve been avoiding them.</p>
<p>The driving was because I haven&rsquo;t found a good way to have my mother live alone for more than a few weeks at a time. I haven&rsquo;t worked out a strategy for getting her help while preserving as much of her independence as possible. So I&rsquo;ve been the help.</p>
<p>Maybe that‚Äôs a good thing, even if it often feels like I‚Äôm treading water. During my father‚Äôs final months, everything had to be about him. Now I‚Äôm able to take the time to work out my mother‚Äôs specific needs, even as she works out the business of living as a widow after more than sixty-five years of marriage.</p>
<p>Besides, a health issue has come up that we have to deal with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The war is a profound turning point, ending any pretense of ‚Äúsoft‚Äù authoritarianism with its modicum of space for resistance. The Kremlin‚Äôs fascist project may not succeed in the end, but it is crucial to see its effects within Russia as a fundamental component of the 2022 attack on Ukraine‚Ä¶. The Kremlin structures its war-making machine in ways that deliberately produce atrocity‚Ä¶. [And on TV, there is] a &ldquo;pedagogy&rdquo; of exterminist consciousness and practice, a key tool of the fascist project unfolding within and beyond Russia.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s so hard to look away from Musk&rsquo;s wrecking ball when I go to Twitter for voices on Ukraine. Also hard not to comment on other people&rsquo;s posts. Now the would-be dictator of the bird site is banning and unbanning journalists, depending on his mood and random Twitter polls. He&rsquo;s also banning links to all kinds of outside networks, even Linktree. He might change his mind about some sites by playing the gracious leader who puts things to a plebiscite, but who needs that? More and more diehards are leaving. I&rsquo;d like to see regulators take an aggressive look at what he&rsquo;s doing. But I&rsquo;d also like to see media outlets, government offices, and other big institutions set up their own Mastodon servers to render the Big Twit&rsquo;s actions moot.</p>
<p>Evening update: Poof! Just like that, the latest stupid policies have vanished from the bird site&rsquo;s support pages, while Musk is conducting a poll about whether he should hire a different CEO in place of himself. Of course, none or all of these things could be true by morning.</p>

			 <p>The new owner of Twitter is turning that site into something of a dumpster fire, so I have set up an account on a Mastodon server as well. I&rsquo;m not sure where this will lead, but for scholarly communication, at least, it seems like a no-brainer, especially since so many have joined. At the same time, my fifteen-year Twitter habit will likely die hard because there are people and perspectives there that I can&rsquo;t get anywhere else, at least not yet.</p>

			 <p>Fifteen years ago, I wrote a short post encouraging students to <a href="/2007/05/23/on-writing/">write for themselves</a> on a regular basis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing is hard work for almost everyone, no matter how talented or inspired. Writing is thinking. Good writers do not usually have finished ideas that they then type out. The process of writing and revision is an act of thinking and discovery. . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A couple days ago, a tweet by a disaster historian came across my timeline that summed things up perfectly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221206013048/https://twitter.com/USofDisaster/status/1573191443669454849"><img src="https://mrstoneman.micro.blog/uploads/2024/294debe207.jpg" alt="Scott Gabriel Knowles: &ldquo;How do people who don&rsquo;t write know what they think about anything?&rdquo; (Sept 23, 2022)"></a><br>
(‚ÄâTweet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220117202301/https://twitter.com/WmGermano/status/1427032243374104584">archived</a> on the Wayback Machine.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That Scott Knowles expressed this thought on Twitter reminds me that tweeting can also be a form of writing as thinking. This felt particularly true to me back in the 140-character-limit days; however, even with 280 characters and easy threading, Twitter can foster regular reflection, concise expression, and ongoing rephrasing and revision. Moreover, it affords plenty of opportunities to practice these things in conversation with others. Maybe that is what keeps me coming back, especially whenever times feel more topsy-turvy and worrisome than usual.</p>

		<a href="https://markstoneman.com/2022/08/11/more-than-a.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-08-11 16:37:32 -0500">Aug 11, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Perhaps Putin&rsquo;s phrase &ldquo;special military operation&rdquo; should be seen as something more insidious than a euphemism for war. At the very least, it is consistent with Russia&rsquo;s genocidal aims and practices in Ukraine.</p>
<p>If we take the Clausewitzian metaphor of war as a duel somewhat literally, the Russian invasion of Ukraine becomes a struggle between two equals, two entities with the same dignity, the same right to exist. After all, duels have traditionally been fought between two parties capable of giving satisfaction for a perceived injury by one to the other&rsquo;s honor. An officer could duel another officer, but not a sergeant, a lowly conscript, or a civilian occupying a more modest social position.</p>
<p>By calling its invasion a &ldquo;special military operation,&rdquo; Russia denies Ukraine&rsquo;s worthiness and sovereignty. It casts Ukraine and Ukrainians as other, fundamentally inferior, or devoid of honor, so to speak. Rejecting Ukrainian statehood outright, the term ‚Äúspecial military operation‚Äù facilitates what the talking heads in Russia discuss openly on state TV: genocide, the elimination of Ukrainian culture, ethnicity, and language.</p>
<p>At the same time, the term &ldquo;special military operation&rdquo; renders Ukrainian resistance illegitimate in Russian eyes. Thus, Russia brands the soldiers who defended Mariupol to the end &ldquo;terrorists.&rdquo; And its leaders become apoplectic when Ukraine dares to fire on targets inside Russia and Russian-occupied Crimea.</p>
<p>Given the logic of Russia‚Äôs rhetoric and violence, the problem with &ldquo;special military operation&rdquo; becomes one not only of euphemism hiding war from Russians. The euphemism also creates space for, even favors, genocidal rhetoric and policy.</p>

<p>My brother took the above photo on his trip to New Hampshire last month. It&rsquo;s the old barn at the house we grew up in, viewed from a dirt road. Below is a picture he took of that house. It was badly in need of paint nine years ago, when my parents sold it, but it looks like it&rsquo;s in good shape now. The biggest maple tree out front had to be cut down, but the smallest one isn&rsquo;t looking so small anymore.</p>

			 <p>It feels strange to be back home in DC after nine months away in rural New Hampshire. And I&rsquo;m driving back up next week for my father&rsquo;s memorial service‚Äîdriving because flying sounds like a terrible option these days.</p>
<p>My father was able to live at home for most of these past months. Facilitating that was a two-person job, mine and my octogenarian mother&rsquo;s. During his last month, he went from hospital to rehab, which I thought might become long-term care, but his old body had other plans.</p>
<p>Fortunately I already knew his wishes, so all three of us were on the same page when it came time. He was at the hospital when we switched him over to hospice care, a small hospital in the White Mountains, and the staff was brilliant.</p>
<p>My son made it up the last week, as did my sisters and one brother-in-law. Even my brother, who I hadn&rsquo;t seen in thirty years, flew in. On one of the last days the old man could speak, a nurse told him he was lucky. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>So it goes.</p>
<p>Early last fall, during a drive down to a different hospital to pick up my father,  my wife called me. Our first grandchild was coming. And then another call: she was there.</p>

			 <p>As a historian who sometimes teaches about Europe in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, I have to give Trump credit for one thing: His constant upending of the broad political consensus that emerged after World War II and the Cold War means that basic historical terms are constantly making it into the news and national discourse as quasi new problems, new questions. As upsetting as these times are, as abhorrent as Trump is, it is hard to deny the value of Ron Elving‚Äôs reaction to the president‚Äôs recent statement about being a nationalist: ‚ÄúWe are about to have a national conversation about the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/10/24/660042653/what-is-a-nationalist-in-the-age-of-trump" title="What is a Nationalist in the Age of Trump">word nationalist</a>. And Elving wants to offer nuances to the term‚Äôs meanings in past and present‚Äîwell, as much as anyone can in some 1,100 words.</p>

<p>In my initial academic encounters with Germany in the late 1980s and early 1990s, one of the things that impressed me was the availability of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->handbooks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as well as specialized encyclopedias such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The textbook series <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oldenbourg Grundriss der Geschichte<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was a new experience for me.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Each volume offered a concise, chronologically organized survey (with key terms in the margins for rapid orientation), followed by a substantial historiographical discussion and bibliography. At the time, I did not appreciate the massive effort behind such compilation and systematization efforts. I just found these tools were quite practical for orienting myself in a given historical subject. Why didn&rsquo;t we have such useful tools in the United States?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I do know that my doctoral advisor&rsquo;s approach to reading lists for our comprehensive exams at Georgetown University in the mid-to-late 1990s was unusual in the history department there. Roger Chickering gave us a massive bibliography for research purposes along with a so-called canon (read: very long list) of the texts that he expected every PhD student to know or at least know about.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> For my reading in Soviet, Imperial Russian, modern French, and modern British history, I had to write up my own reading lists, sometimes with suggestions by the professor, never with the ambitious, perhaps Sisyphean intention of producing a canon.</p>
<p>Roger Chickering, of course, is both product and producer of the American academic landscape, and he has deep ties in the German one too. The above example, however, is not meant to suggest that his approach was in any way related to its proximity to German academic culture. Instead, I mention it in order to underline what I sense is an additional reason for the (to my mind) weaker handbook culture in the United States, at least among historians. Such systematization is hard and its desirability not clear.</p>
<p>The nice thing about this blog is that it does not require massive overhead, although it does seem to have some institutional support. Nor must an entire handbook be conceived and created before anyone can use the knowledge being gathered and produced for it. The blog simply grows over time (since 2011) and can respond to new concerns and concentrations with tweaks to its categories and tags.</p>
<p>I bring this up because I was struck by a recent post on the francophone blog <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Germano-Fil<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a Franco-German production. The post is entitled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚ÄúRecherche bibliographique en France et en Allemagne‚Äù<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and contains a wonderfully useful list of resources, the kind I would like to have had when I was studying German history. This list would also fit in one of the more traditional handbooks, but it is on a blog and can be accessed easily via the site&rsquo;s category links, which act like a table of contents. Does such a detailed resource even exist in English for the study of German history? Hard to imagine.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another site, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->historicum.net<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is a cross between a reference work and a reference library for students of history. Such an undertaking, of course, requires substantial institutional support, at least that is the impression I get from the extensive content, not to mention the logos of the project&rsquo;s sponsors‚Äîthe Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Universit√§t K√∂ln, and the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Docupedia-Zeitgeshichte<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> also recalls a multivolume handbook with a correspondingly large editorial team. Like on GHDI and <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->historicum.net<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Docupedia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s articles contain no tags or links to establish connections across entries. Instead, each piece reads like a traditional handbook article. In other words, the enterprise comports with the traditional research and writing practices of professional historians.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about blogs in terms of academic cultures for another reason as well. The above-mentioned blog has an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ISSN<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an identifier for periodicals. My encounters with academic blogs in the past decade or so have not involved this kind of identifier. Yet a number of academic blogs in Germany, at least blogs with some sort of institutional support, not to mention all blogs on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hypotheses<!-- raw HTML omitted --> portal, are now using the ISSN. Why?</p>
<p>According to the international organization behind this numbering system, ‚ÄúThe ISSN role is to identify a publication,‚Äù thereby preventing possible confusion with similarly named publications, for example. But this ‚Äúdigital code [[is]] without any intrinsic meaning.‚Äù The ISSN contains no ‚Äúinformation about the origin or contents of the publication,‚Äù and, most importantly in the present context, ‚Äúit does not guarantee the quality or validity of the contents.‚Äù<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Nevertheless, on the blogs I have been encountering, this number appears to be about making the web publication look more serious or legitimate. In Germany at least, but maybe further afield, the ISSN can apparently make blogs accessible to library catalogs, as well as to an international open access directory called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ROAD<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; however, it is hard to escape the impression that for blogs, the ISSN is more about gaining recognition.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Academic culture might be a factor too.</p>
<p>Academic cultures with a long and deep history tend to influence the ways in which new media formats are used. Blogs, for example, offer the advantage of speed. One can put pixels to screen and share one‚Äôs thoughts almost instantly. Gatekeepers are practically nonexistent. Instead, it is up to bloggers to make clear who they are so that readers can judge for themselves the worthiness and reliability of the blog. In my view, these factors constitute advantages, but they can leave scholars uneasy, steeped as they are in a specific academic culture. Thus, some blogs take on the forms of more traditional academic publications.</p>
<p>See, for example, the impressive and seemingly well-funded <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Verfassungsblog: On Matters Constitutional<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, whose posts often even include a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DOI<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a tool to ensure the long-term availability of a piece, even in the face of changing hyperlinks or dying websites. Aside from longevity, this approach might have the merit of making it easier for scholars to include any substantial blog posts they write on their curricular vitae. On the other hand, DOIs would seem to entail a prohibitive amount of extra work for many of us, perhaps militating against the rapid communication of ideas and research results that a blog can make possible.</p>
<p>Many research blogs give me the impression that their authors understand blogging and peer-reviewed journal publications as complementary. The former allows faster publication as well as more provisional and personal writings, but it in no way precludes developing one‚Äôs blogged thoughts further toward a peer-reviewed article or book. Conversation can also occur more easily in the blog format, since a response to one blog post can be written and published in a matter of mere hours or days, if that long. The benefits of such speed and interaction would seem to outweigh any need to &ldquo;legitimize&rdquo; a blog by adding the trappings of a more conventional periodical.</p>
<p>None of these observations amount to a specific argument or program, but I thought they might be worth sharing in the context of a blog about knowledge. Self-reflexivity should be part of any scholarly undertaking. Moreover, some of our contributors might be new to or skeptical about blogging as a form of scholarly communication and knowledge production.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If military service had become a rite of passage for young men in much of Europe well before the mutual slaughter began in the summer of 1914, neither its ubiquity nor its meaning to those it embraced were foregone conclusions. To be sure, the fundamental challenge offered by the declaration of the lev√©e en masse in revolutionary France in 1793 represented an important first step, as did monarchical Prussia‚Äôs turn in 1813 to the near-general conscription of those men considered young and fit enough to join the fight. Indeed, Prussia‚Äôs response to the Napoleonic challenge intertwined military service, citizenship, and manhood in the gendered construction of a nation at war that bore a striking resemblance to those ideals manifest in the mobilizations of 1914.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Nonetheless, near-universal manhood conscription took many more decades to predominate on the continent (never mind the United Kingdom, which did not resort to it until 1916).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, the path was not at all direct, not from the state‚Äôs and army‚Äôs side nor from the general population‚Äôs. For the state and its military leadership, big citizens‚Äô armies could be desirable for fighting a foreign enemy, but they could also present a threat to the domestic-political status quo because they might not allow themselves to be used to suppress protest or insurrection at home. A further decisive factor was technology and how military leaders came to use it. Especially important were the railroads and the development of strategic thought and organizational structures that placed a premium on mobilizing large numbers of men at once for a decisive blow of the kind Helmuth von Moltke pulled off for Prussia at K√∂niggr√§tz (aka Sadowa) in 1866 and at Sedan in 1870 during the wars that produced a German nation-state.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Of course, an approach to war of this kind also required large numbers of trained conscripts and experienced reservists. But first things first. The men targeted by conscription (and then the reserves) and the families and communities in which they had been raised first needed to learn to see the state‚Äôs call to the colors as legitimate and inescapable, let alone perceive value in the prospect.</p>
<p>Nineteenth-century discourses and attitudes regarding conscription were informed by normative assumptions about manhood in connection with a wide range of topics‚Äîcivic or national duty and martial sacrifice, forbearance and manliness, masculinity and bravery, willpower and human flesh versus modern weaponry (especially later in the century), the impact of length of service on soldiers‚Äô relationship to civilian society, civilian upbringings and soldiers‚Äô political reliability, the reputational impact of military service on veterans returning to civilian life, and so on. The gendered matrix of military service and citizenship was integral to warfare and its sociopolitical effects in Europe. This matrix is the subject of the first of three thematic sections comprising this [unrealized] chapter. Ordinary men in uniform occupy the center of this analysis, but other men and women who joined or supported the armed struggles‚Äîinterstate and intrastate‚Äîare also considered.</p>
<p>The importance and meaning of conscription in this period was also affected by the increasing cachet of nationality as an organizing principle for the European state system, or at least as a cultural manifestation that states could leverage.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Whether in the ranks as conscripts, as substitutes for conscripts, as wartime volunteers, or by vocation, soldiers were beginning to be identified‚Äîand even identify themselves, at least in wartime‚Äîwith the nation-state or the national cause that they served. Many fought in conflicts that had national resonance among the general population, such as the Crimean War (1853‚Äì56), and many others fought in wars that led to the creation of the Italian and German nation-states (achieved in 1861 and 1871, respectively). The last case also entailed the national humiliation of France‚Äîwidely felt in that country‚Äîin a series of disastrous defeats (1870‚Äì71).</p>
<p>These conflicts did not just involve soldiers in the service of the state, however. The rise of nationality and ‚Äúthe people‚Äù as relevant factors saw men (and even women) join irregular formations to attain their national goals or, in the case of Italy, at least redeem their nation‚Äôs honor, whether that meant overturning a foreign or particularistic ruler (especially during the European revolutions of 1848) or defending their nation against a foreign invader or dying in the attempt. Or so the nationalist narratives went, even if some probably took up arms to defend their home and locality against the privations of requisitioning and marauding.</p>
<p>These decades also saw men and women (and youth) in cities resort to violence in order to change constitutional structures or protest economic and social conditions.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Whether or not any military experience was involved in the barricade building of 1848, memories of earlier revolts had certainly been passed down to the frequently subaltern generations of that time, a legacy that was also evident during the Paris Commune‚Äôs struggle in 1871.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Intertwined with implicit and explicit discourses about citizenship and belonging‚Äîand thus about manhood and womanhood, too‚Äîthese episodes also belonged to the complex, often violent process of nation formation and consolidation. At the same time, in this context of nation-making wars and insurrections, the seemingly contradictory phenomenon of international volunteers serving a national cause must also be considered.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>The circles of social actors and norms to potentially include in a gendered analysis of the above mentioned wars and insurrections could be expanded a great deal further, if space constraints and available research permitted it. Whenever gender played a role in constructing or understanding the motivation and practices of those fighting, that role conceptually comprised both masculinity and femininity because gender, like class and race, is a relational concept. If the military world had become almost exclusively male and masculine in the nineteenth century, that manhood still presupposed relationships with women and femininity.</p>
<p>Normative femininity might be embodied in the appearance and comportment of women accompanying the army (in France, holdovers like the cantin√®re) or nursing the wounded (in the Crimea, Mary Seacole and Florence Nightingale). There were also the women at home for whom one fought, or the girl one intended to marry after completing active duty. Normative images of women in the minds of soldiers could affect those soldiers‚Äô reactions to encounters with women in wartime, in the course of requisitioning food from civilians or sleeping in civilians‚Äô homes or outbuildings‚Äîor when fighting irregulars or taking a town street by street. Finally, a siege army could not make distinctions between soldiers and civilians, men and woman, adults and children in a besieged city (as in the Prussian-German siege of Paris in 1870‚Äì71). On the other hand, policy decisions reached in the besieged city itself (or policy lacunae) could create great differences‚Äîbetween rich and poor, soldiers and civilians (and therefore also between men and women), and so on.</p>
<p>No matter how powerful memories of the lev√©e en masse continued to be in the middle decades of nineteenth century France, to take the most famous example of a nation in arms, patriotism and √©lan were not enough to win wars. One also needed professional expertise to train and lead men in war or in the suppression of an insurrection. With different educational levels and frequently a more elevated social background, officers might well embody masculinity differently than the men in their charge, especially if they were noblemen. Furthermore, as military technologies grew and military organizations became more complex, the knowledge required by at least some of the officers expanded. As the job changed, so too could the men doing it.</p>
<p>These developments were accompanied by public and internal debates about military leadership. What qualities did officers require? From which stock was recruitment most desirable? What training did they require? What was their relationship to their men supposed to look like? How did they treat their subordinates? And what about their relationship to acknowledged social equals and supposed inferiors‚Äîespecially men‚Äîoutside the military? How did their expertise and comportment figure into their practice of masculinity and its reception? What did military service and sacrifice mean to these men? How did social background and family history shape that meaning? Finally, what about their private lives? How did marriage and family fit into their military careers? To what extent did the bourgeois ideal of a separate domestic sphere obtain in this context? Of course, each of these questions could lead to more than one answer because officer corps were by no means homogeneous.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Furthermore, some important military leaders did not fit within this framework at all, most prominently Giuseppe Garibaldi, whose biography, relationship to his fighters, and influential public image form an instructive counterpoint.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, if soldiers were citizens acting on behalf of the nation, their actions might be expected to bear a closer relationship to the values and norms that guided their behavior in civilian life. Actual or alleged practices in wartime that appeared contrary to the predominant normative conception of war‚Äîstill largely informed by the metaphor of a dual between two equal and honorable parties‚Äîexposed the perpetrator to charges of acting in an unmanly or unwomanly way and, by extension, his or her nation to charges of dishonorable, uncivilized behavior. Purported atrocities and other perceived wrongdoings also created opportunities for soldiers to exact revenge with drastic countermeasures that could contradict taboos on destroying property and even those on killing women.</p>
<p>Of course, such measures were never just about the attitudes of soldiers, but also the command climate, discipline, and policy goals. Furthermore, gendered contemporary reports and commentaries on the violence could be more about demonizing the enemy than about actual events or understanding what happened. The main examples explored in this section involve face-to-face encounters between German soldiers and French civilians in 1870‚Äì71 and the extreme use of violence by Thiers‚Äôs forces against the Commune in 1871.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
<p>All three sections [so was my plan] proceed from the fundamental premise that practices and experiences of manhood and womanhood are historically contingent, that men and women change over time, that normative masculinities and femininities change with them. The seemingly natural in their attitudes and behaviors is cultural and therefore a product of history. The second corollary premise is that war and warriors are creatures of their times, influenced by‚Äîand influencing‚Äîthem. Contrary to many narrowly conceived histories, not to mention widespread ahistorical elements of popular culture, there is no universal soldier or military leader.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> Here, too, biology need not be destiny, whereas culture, if not properly analyzed in historical context, very well could be.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
<p>The third premise is that although the dual political and technological revolutions of the nineteenth century match up chronologically with the emergence of ‚Äútotal war‚Äù in the twentieth century, the journey never involved only a single plot line that led inexorably to 1914. Focusing on the role of gender‚Äîa fundamental component of human culture‚Äîcan help to make other formative strands of the story visible. It then becomes possible to complicate Stig F√∂rster‚Äôs powerful typology of warfare‚Äôs development in the modern era‚Äîcabinet war, people‚Äôs war, industrialized people‚Äôs war, and total war‚Äîwhose emphasis on parallel developments in war and politics can resemble a teleology, one subverted by events after 1945 and hard to reconcile with developments in warfare in other eras and cultures.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p>

			 <p>In a blog post earlier this month, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;From Cultural History to the History of Knowledge&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Johan √ñstling and David Larsson Heidenblad examine the attraction and potential utility of the history of knowledge as an historiographical approach. Particularly helpful is their attempt to tease out its relationship to cultural history.</p>

<p>&hellip;The iterative practice of regular blogging has its own set of joys. For me, writing begets writing. The blog doesn‚Äôt distract from my formal academic or scholarly work. It feeds it. It becomes a form of discipline, like doing sit-ups every morning, a practice I long ago abandoned. My abdominal muscles are flabby, but when I sit down to write, whatever the context, I feel strong.</p>

			 <p>Am still shaking my head over the new administration‚Äôs discriminatory ban on Muslims entering the United States. It was no surprise after the hateful rhetoric of the election season, but announcing it on Holocaust Remembrance Day? And not mentioning Jews in a statement about the Holocaust? I wish I could call these actions tone-deaf, but they feel more intentional and sinister than that, even if the more apt historical parallels are the U.S. rejection of Jews fleeing Nazism and the internment of Japanese-Americans as an entire class of people during the Second World War.</p>

			 <p>One of the new research focuses at the GHI since our director, Simone L√§ssig, began her tenure last October is the history of knowledge.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The study of knowledge in its societal context (as opposed to thought experiments about truth in the discipline of philosophy) has some tradition in sociology and anthropology, but it is still a relatively new focus in English-language historiography, at least in my experience.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>A good introduction for me was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Peter Burke, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What is the History of Knowledge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (polity, 2016)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It says more about what the field can encompass than it does about historiographical debates or plausible narratives. Still, for an outsider like me, the book offers helpful vocabulary and categories with which to begin thinking about this subject. A different kind of text that I also found useful is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ian F. McNeely and Lisa Wolverton, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reinventing Knowledge: From Alexandria to the Internet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2008)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If the focus is on the West and elite knowledge, and if it offers generalizations that specialists might pick apart, it has the merit of offering a narrative that helps the reader to think about the production, preservation, transmission, and consumption of knowledge over a long span of time. I find such historical narratives absolutely necessary when first getting my feet wet in a subject.</p>
<p>Knowledge history can encompass faith traditions and the academic disciplines, of course, but it can go well beyond that to all walks of life, whether the knowledge is explicit or implicit, published or produced and transmitted in a workshop, and so on. With its interest in what people know and how they produce, use, and disseminate this knowledge, knowledge history does not feel all that strange from the perspective of social and cultural history. Indeed, knowledge history seems capable of dovetailing productively with these more familiar approaches.</p>
<p>In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Isabel Hull, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Absolute Destruction<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (Cornell UP, 2006)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for example, we learn that army officers in Imperial Germany shared a certain understanding and approach to war despite their diverse training, career paths, and experiences; however, we never learn how they came to share this common military culture. If we consider what these men <!-- raw HTML omitted -->knew<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about war, we still have a phenomenon whose cultural logic can be unpacked, but now we can also start asking about the education, training, and acculturation that helped transform young men into military professionals. In other words, we can begin to think about how and what officers learned and knew as well as how they produced and transmitted this knowledge. In this way, a static image of culture becomes dynamic, capable of changing over time.</p>
<p>The history of knowledge is not all that foreign to the business and consumption history I edited under the previous director either, even if that history has not been written with the history of knowledge in mind or in the vein of cultural history. The most interesting book of this type I encountered was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hartmut Berghoff, Philip Scranton, and Uwe Spiekermann, eds., <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Rise of Marketing and Market Research<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (Palgrave, 2012)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The titles of its individual chapters might sound highly specialized, but together they show how different social and economic actors came to conceive and understand the markets in which they were operating in ways that modernday ideological adherence to capitalism as a natural, ahistorical phenomenon remains oblivious. The subtitle of the introduction includes the term ‚Äúinformation‚Äù (not ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù) but many of the examples in the book show entrepreneurs and others producing knowledge, that is, coming up with new ways to understand society and gather and use data to sell goods.</p>
<p>In hindsight, I think I found this particular book so interesting because of the knowledge aspect of the topic. For example, in ‚ÄúMaking the Ledgers Talk: Customer Control and the Origins of Data Mining,‚Äù Josh Lauer shows how U.S. department stores in the early decades of the twentieth century had credit departments‚Äînot necessarily profitable‚Äîas a service to their customers. Yet some people in these departments came to understand how much sales data they were sitting on and began to use it to target specific kinds of customers with direct mail campaigns, based on their specific purchase histories. In other words, these credit departments took information already on hand and transformed it into new knowledge about their customers that could be used to increase sales.</p>

			 <p>I have had to withdraw from an interesting handbook project because of excessive overlap with two other chapters. My topic was on the matrix of gender, war, and nation in European wars in the 1850s through the 1870s. Given the limited historiography, I chose a thematic approach, but that produces the undesired overlap. What is needed instead, I&rsquo;m told, is a gendered history of these specific wars. Leaving aside the insufficient historiography, to say nothing of the challenges inherent in collaborations of this kind, where project requirements and individual research have to somehow come together and adapt to changing parameters, the impasse I&rsquo;ve reached seems to have deeper epistemological roots.</p>
<p>Making sense of the matrix of gender, nation, and war in the European conflicts of the mid-nineteenth century appears to involve contradictory historiographical impulses. On the one hand, the revolutions, insurrections, and wars of this era represented discrete political events in specific temporal, geographic, social, cultural, economic, and technological contexts. On the other hand, solidarities or identities represented by the nation emerged and achieved hegemonic status over much longer periods of time (even if war acted as a catalyst), to say nothing of the resilient normative and structural operations of gender in human societies.</p>
<p>If one scholar has successfully identified a discursive relationship among nationalism, military service, and the masculine construction of citizenship in Prussia during the Wars of Liberation against Napoleon, making the leap from those discourses to changes in gender norms (including the shifting meaning of military service in a man&rsquo;s life) and how gender operated in social hierarchies is another matter. Depending on the region of Europe, it could take many decades for such discourses to manifest themselves in ordinary people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>These contradictory historiographical impulses are also evident in gender history itself. If the field (earlier conceived as women&rsquo;s history) had initially promised to challenge and subvert conventional periodization schemes, the professional requirements of specialization in specific eras and regions has tended to reproduce those schemes instead.</p>
<p>If I have been unable to navigate these tensions and contradictions within the limited scope left open to me in the handbook project and given the limitations of the historiography itself, I nonetheless find myself wondering how they might be addressed within event-driven history more generally. Clearly one can explore the operations of gender in a specific war, but is it possible to draw conclusions about changes in gender norms and gender orders without taking a much longer view? I am skeptical.</p>

			 <p>One evening after work recently, I was half-starved and wanted something I could cook quickly. I saw some packaged gnocchi in the cupboard, made by De Cecco, which I thought would fit the bill, until I started reading the directions. Unfortunately, these were quite long, and they mentioned all kinds of ingredients not in the package, so I gave up. I didn‚Äôt want a detailed recipe. I just wanted to know how to cook the gnocchi. A few days later, while editing an English translation of a book about Italians and food in the modern era, I learned something that made me go back to the gnocchi.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In the early post‚ÄìWorld War II decades, when the Italian food industry was trying to get consumers‚Äîin this context mainly women‚Äîto buy its new, ready-made food products, it decided that offering detailed preparation suggestions for the integration of other foods into its packaged products would improve the image of the new products, that is, make them more legitimate and appealing. But consumers bought ready-made foods for their convenience, not for the opportunity to prepare something elaborate. If one wanted to make something more involved, one could do it the old-fashioned way, from scratch, even if one might use certain intermediate manufactured goods like bouillon cubes or dry pasta.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>With this nugget about Italy‚Äôs food history in hand, I went back to the gnocchi package whose directions had thwarted me earlier. I still found only one very detailed paragraph, nothing short about the gnocchi themselves, as pasta packages in this country have led me to expect. But this time I decided I had better skip ahead in the directions, and, sure enough, what I needed was there, buried near the end: ‚ÄúIn the meantime, cook the gnocchi in plenty of boiling salted water, remove them as they rise to the surface ‚Ä¶‚Äù So that was what the ‚Äúready in 2 min.‚Äù label on the front of the package was referring to. Apparently this step is such common knowledge in Italy that there is no reason to highlight it in readily accessible instructions, even if the manufacturer still feels the need to make its product more attractive to potential customers with a detailed recipe.</p>
<p>But the package in my hand was for the American market, so why attach the same, apparently decades-old assumptions about food and gender in Italy to it? It hardly makes sense, except if explained in terms of the product‚Äôs postwar Italian history. Language from that context seems to have been translated into English without giving much thought to this context. Or is this a way to market something very ordinary, little potato dumplings, as something special? In any case, I‚Äôm pretty sure that the packaged gnocchi my European spouse bought for the pantry still carry part of their history in the accompanying directions, which at least I can read now.</p>

			 <p>At a recent lecture on the Great War, Roger Chickering said, ‚ÄúI&rsquo;m not a military historian.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The phrase stuck in my mind because he said it two more times during the course of the lecture and discussion. I‚Äôm sure he was trying to avoid letting the discussion get sidetracked by narrower debates about military operations, which was fair enough in the context of his talk about a series of common structural elements in Germany‚Äôs, France‚Äôs, and Great Britain‚Äôs wars. Nonetheless, his words bothered me.</p>
<p>Of course, there was nothing surprising about the statement. And Chickering really can‚Äôt be called a ‚Äúmilitary historian‚Äù in the narrow sense of the term. Nor can I, his former student. But if stating that one is ‚Äúnot a military historian‚Äù makes sense in terms of the prejudices of too many academic historians, it also cedes the ground of professional competence to those historians who only focus on the battlefield.</p>
<p>As legitimate as narrower operational and tactical studies of warfare are, their authors cannot be allowed to enjoy a monopoly on the interpretation of the more military-technical aspects of warfare. The broad expertise and perspective of the historian who studies war‚Äôs manifestations away from the violence is also needed for the battlefield and everywhere else that people were killing or being killed for ostensibly political aims.</p>

			 <p>The main assignment for my graduate survey of modern Europe this summer was to write an essay that incorporated all of the assigned books and most of the assigned articles. I conceived of this assignment because of a similar one that I had had to do as a graduate student that I found especially productive, if difficult. (See <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2010/08/14/learning-to-synthesize.html">Learning to Synthesize History</a>.)</p>
<p>The essays my students wrote fulfilled or exceeded my expectations in some cases, but there were others that did not go as well as they could have. In part, this was due to the compressed nature of the summer term, but more than anything else, I think building a deliberate approach to teaching the process of synthesis into the course syllabus would have helped. Yes, these students were in an M.A. program and had taken many history courses in their lives, but few had ever had to do such an assignment.</p>
<p>Of course, we spoke about process both in class and in individual meetings, but the current senior research seminar I am teaching, which includes explicit work on process, suggests to me that I should formalize such efforts in graduate courses too, if I am going to require an unfamiliar writing task. That&rsquo;s not how I learned as a graduate student, but so what?</p>

			 <p>My research deals with war and society, while my editorial work addresses mainly consumption history. One might think these are two different worlds, but I&rsquo;m coming to doubt the validity of such assumptions. Indeed, the subfields of military and business history have a lot of similarities. Most obviously, they are both interested in organizations, knowledge, experts, and elites‚Äîamong other things. They are also both informed by a tension between the historian&rsquo;s ethos to understand the past for its own sake and the practitioner&rsquo;s desire to learn lessons from that past for today. And they both have homes not only in history departments, but also institutions that train future generations of professionals, whether officers or MBAs. This tension also means that military history and business history are sometimes looked down on by the field of history more generally, even though bread-and-butter themes such as class, race, gender, citizenship, politics, and power more generally cannot be adequately understood without consideration of militaries and businesses.</p>

<p>Consumption is a vital part of the story in Gerald Feldman&rsquo;s classic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Army, Industry, and Labor in Germany, 1914‚Äî1918<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (1966), insofar as the purchasing power of labor was inextricably linked to Germany&rsquo;s social and political stability and, therefore, the country&rsquo;s ability to produce sufficient armaments to continue fighting. The point is more accessible in Roger Chickering, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914‚Äî1918<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (1998 and 2004), which I have used in a course on the Great War and will use again next fall in one on modern Germany. There is also Belinda Davis, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Home Fires Burning: Food, Politics, and Everyday Life in World War I Berlin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (2000), which I will be using in a graduate course on war and society this summer.</p>
<p>I also usually bring up a much earlier aspect of consumption history when I address the Enlightenment and the public sphere: coffee houses. To make this point, there is a delightful reading from before the Enlightenment on the Internet Modern History Sourcebook: &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The First English Coffee-Houses, c. 1670‚Äî1675<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, none of this is informed by a specific historiography of consumption history, but it does point out how this topic is already in my teaching. But there&rsquo;s a difference between including a topic and addressing it systematically. To think about war and society in Europe, I can at least draw on the periodizing nomenclature of &ldquo;cabinet war,&rdquo; &ldquo;people&rsquo;s war,&rdquo; and &ldquo;total war&rdquo; to help describe the level of societal involvement in interstate conflicts over the past few centuries (Stig F√∂rster et al.). If such language and periodization exists for understanding consumption history, I have not yet learned it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the main point is to recognize modern consumer societies as having a history in the first place, instead of taking them as a direct reflection of human nature and, hence, rendering them ahistorical, as too often happens in simplistic political rhetoric that opposes capitalism and communism‚Äîrhetoric that invariably finds its way into student spoken and written comments. I sometimes try to do this with economic thought in the early modern period, but historicizing capitalism should be a central historiographical problem for the modern era, too.</p>

			 <p>History is one of those subjects that politicians and the general public are never going to leave to historians alone. I‚Äôve got no problem with that, if those doing it follow basic rules of evidence and have a decent sense of what historical thinking is. I wish those proclaiming what they take to be the truth of history were more interested in discovering that truth than reshaping history to illustrate their own political beliefs. Such a phenomenon is not new, but the current trend among some conservatives to rewrite American history to fit their image of America today is irksome at best, downright troubling at worst, especially if such ‚Äúhistory‚Äù enters the classroom.</p>
<p>For a taste of this phenomenon, read Steven Thomma, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110703075955/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/04/01/91478/some-conservatives-rewrite-history.html">&ldquo;Not satisfied with U.S. history, some conservatives are rewriting it&rdquo;</a> (McClatchy Newspapers). You might want to view the video on that page too. It would be interesting to find a longer piece in a venue that permitted footnotes to lead to further reading, but I suspect most academic historians do not take these rewritings of history seriously enough to address them. Such battles over history will be fought in the media instead, the standard of truth frequently being ideological purity. Let the buyer beware.</p>

			 <p>I had no plagiarism cases this fall. Maybe it is because I had an unusually ethical group of students, but it probably also had something to do with analysis they did based on short documents instead of books commonly discussed on the internet. With few exceptions, there were no answers to be found on the internet, though I took some chances with the inclusion of <em>A Doll&rsquo;s House</em> in some questions. Even then, I did not let students focus on Ibsen&rsquo;s play, but instead forced them to relate it to short documents that I made available on Blackboard. I have made similar attempts in the past, but usually by asking big synthetic questions based on two or three books instead of narrower interpretive questions based mainly on two or three specific documents.</p>
<p>Another variable was length. These source analysis exercises were only two pages, if that, which might have been short enough to prevent the kind of panic that leads to some plagiarism cases. Of course, two pages is less than ideal, but I had more than 150 students this past fall. Even with a grader to help me 10 hours per week, there was an enormous amount of assessment to do, especially since there were three of these exercises.</p>
<p>On a related note, in the coming semester I am going over to the dark side with some quizzes and parts of my exams. By that I mean I will be integrating some multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank elements. As much as I prefer to have students actively produce knowledge in exams, there is a limit to how much grading I can and should do, a limit I far exceeded last semester. Moreover, I will still be having them do analysis. Unfortunately, multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions can raise the specter of copying in overcrowded classrooms. It is with this issue in mind that I plan to use multiple versions of quizzes and exams. I am just not sure if I will have to create these by hand or if there is an easy and free technological solution.</p>

			 <p>The battle over health care reform has got me down. Like last year during the presidential campaign, one has to deal with two discursive opponents. On one hand, there are huge packs of lies being spread. On the other hand, there is the actual question of the government‚Äôs role in health care. If only we could concentrate on just this second thing and the actual proposals being discussed.</p>
<p>Instead of this being a relatively normal legislative process, all the so-called town hall meetings have turned this into an extension of last year‚Äôs campaign. It just doesn‚Äôt end. I suppose if I actually had a representative, I would get more involved in the process, but DC citizens have no representation in Congress. Instead I seek solace in The Daily Show with John Stewart, a little corner in our peculiar political universe that offers sanity, civility, and humor.</p>

			 <p>I had planned to finish my grading yesterday, but that has to happen today. I was just too exhausted. Looking at the wreckage around me that is my apartment, I wondered why. I also wondered about the incredibly fast passage of time. Ten weeks of a daily intensive history course in the afternoon (in two consecutive parts) and two four-week evening courses, three hours per evening, three evenings per week, with a three-hour minimum round trip commute on top of that help to explain both my exhaustion and temporal dislocation. But that came on top of twenty weeks non-stop ESL teaching at another place, sixteen of those weeks including morning and evening work. And I have continued my Saturday ESL. In other words, I have just finished thirty six-day weeks of teaching, with the exception of two days off over Memorial Day weekend and three days for the Fourth.</p>
<p>If this actually amounted to a living income in the DC area, I could be happy. Instead, it just lets me almost get by, sort of, because it is all paid by the course (history) or hour (ESL). Of course, in these economic times, survival is a pretty good achievement too. And I do like <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2009/07/23/miracle-workers-by.html">what I do</a>.</p>
<p>There is a ton of planning to do for Mason this fall, because I will have three sections of Western Civ with fifty-five students each. I am supposed to have a grader for ten hours per week, which will lighten the burden, but I have to plan in such a way that I can survive if the grader doesn‚Äôt come through. The early morning section will be a killer, because of the commute, but I am looking forward to a semester with all the teaching in the same part of the day, in this case from morning until early afternoon. Putting that aside, though, I have three whole weeks where I can work but not commute or manage a classroom. I really need that.</p>

			 <p>The Bush administration seems to have been more freaked out by 9/11 than I realized. Just how far down a paranoid path it had drifted is demonstrated by the newest revelation of a measure it was contemplating back in 2002: <a href="https://archive.ph/MTqTC">using the military to arrest terror suspects in the United States</a>. Bush ultimately went against it, but that it was even contemplated creates an image of a very frightened White House.

			 <p>Our weekly <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2008/03/16/orange-juice-apple.html">farm share</a> feeds two people with room to spare, and often it works okay for three. There is less diversity than at the grocery store, because we eat what is in season, but a lot is in season in the summer. Yesterday‚Äôs share was particularly amazing: Asian greens, salad mix, spinach, kale, spring onions, cauliflower, beets with greens, zucchini, broccoli, kohlrabi, and turnips. These items from our farm were supplemented with couscous, black beans, maple yogurt, shell peas, and blueberries. Yummy!</p>
<p>Yesterday morning was my turn to help count out and set up the food for something like 200 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090625045137/http://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/pubs/csa/csa.shtml">CSA</a> members. It was hot, so I don‚Äôt remember the exact number, but it was a lot. Still, five of us (including my wife) managed to get the bulk of the work done in something like three hours. Of course, this does not count all the organizational and logistical work to get the food there in the first place, or the work done on the farm.</p>
<p>The results are fantastic. High quality food that is good for the earth at affordable prices, and I get to work with good people too.</p>

While this outlet is always important for offering perspectives often overlooked by the mainstream media, its importance has grown during the current crisis, during which authorities have cut off traditional media from firsthand knowledge of the streets. Also interesting are the Iran Updates on the Iranian-American site, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090627105555/http://tehranbureau.com/iran-updates/">Tehran Bureau</a>.

<p>I doubt that a bunch of outsiders blogging for Iran will make any difference in the outcome of the immediate conflict, but I do believe that all the attention we in the West are paying to the Iranians is proving beneficial for the West in general and the United States in particular. No longer abstract Others that are easy to contemplate bombing because we are worried about their country‚Äôs nuclear program, the Iranian people have faces, hopes, and dreams with which we can identify and immense amounts of courage that we can admire.</p>

			 <p>So Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is standing by the highly improbable fiction that the election was a fair one. It seems to me that he and his supporters are playing a dangerous game. Sure, Khamenei has the instruments of oppression at his disposal. He can use the state and vigilante citizens to crack down on the protesters, and he might even win the day. In the end, however, he has made all too clear that the democratic elements of the system are no more than window dressing. Instead of sacrificing his preferred candidate, he is now risking the entire system. How can it now escape the opposition that the president is not the problem, but the entire system itself?</p>

			 <p>It seems to me that Iran‚Äôs clerical leadership is playing a dangerous game. The main opposition candidate is a conservative political insider who supports the current system, but who looks moderate in an Iranian context. His supporters are not demanding a change to the system either. They too just want the system to live up to its own official standards. But as time passes, expectations and goals might very easily expand to a vision that is even more at odds with what Iran‚Äôs clerical leadership wants for the country. Shouldn‚Äôt they concede before this happens?</p>
<p>One problem is that the opposition wants a new election, because the one they just had is tainted. But what would a new election mean? Among other things, more national discourse on the future of the country, and I suspect such a conversation would lead people to probe even deeper into the country‚Äôs problems, perhaps even to their systemic foundation, even if politicians are not allowed to question the country‚Äôs political system.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ahmadinejad‚Äôs supporters could become increasingly insistent about their desires, and that could easily undermine Iran‚Äôs social stability still further. Time is not on the side of those who support the status quo. Unfortunately, that does not mean it is on the side of the opposition.</p>

			 <p>The jury is still out on whether or not Mahmoud Ahmadinejad really won the election and, if so, to what extent. How this will play out is also anybody‚Äôs guess. One thing I already find worrying, however, is Ahmadinejad‚Äôs rhetoric, which talks about freedom and bipartisanship, on one hand, and delegitimizes legitimate political opposition, on the other. The following combination of quotes from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/14/AR2009061400385.html">today‚Äôs <em>Washington Post</em></a> is chilling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This election was so free that you could say it was complete freedom. . . . The election is gone and done. It is time for friendship, coalition and building the country. . . . [Reporters should talk to] true Iranians . . . Like the people you meet at my rallies. . . . [As for the opposition,] There is no other choice than to surrender. . . You think you are of the elite? That you are above the people? . . . The society must be purified of these people. . . . They will try to stop me, but I will expose them to the great nation of Iran.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first statement rings hollow. What is ‚Äúcomplete freedom,‚Äù especially in the Iranian system where unelected religious leaders determines who may run for office? The second statement sounds eminently reasonable, something like a well-wishing plea for bipartisanship in the United States. Then things get spooky. It is one thing to demonize the other side as not truly patriotic. We experienced that last fall with Sarah Palin‚Äôs rhetoric of ‚Äúreal America,‚Äù the ‚Äúmedia elite,‚Äù and so on. While I find such rhetoric reprehensible, at least it did not come right out and say that the other side had no right to exist. It understood the concept of a loyal opposition, even if that opposition supposedly loves America less than Palin‚Äôs and McCain‚Äôs supporters do.</p>
<p>If Ahmadinejad‚Äôs legitimately won the election, which is far from clear, his rhetoric shows that he has no respect for democratic processes. Elections without the concept of a loyal opposition are meaningless. Here‚Äôs hoping that Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader gets that.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will. After all, the oppositional candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, was screened and approved by religious authorities. We are talking about opposition that is legitimate within the narrow confines of Iran‚Äôs political system, not our own. If even that is not acceptable, then what will be left of Iran‚Äôs revolution? Iranian independence, to be sure, as well as clerical rule and possibly the more extensive subjugation of women, but what about the semi-democratic elements of its constitution? The campaign, polling, and post-election protests suggest that they matter to Iranians. And well they should. The legitimacy of Iran‚Äôs post-1979 system depends on them.</p>

And what about those of us who cobble together a series of temporary and part-time jobs that fill up our hours with work, but which do not amount to a job that is eligible for unemployment benefits when some of those gigs fall through?

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Effectiveness Of Harsh Questioning Is Unclear</strong><br>
Detainee May Have Faced Few Traditional Tactics</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This language bothers me. We are talking about torture here, so why not use the term? Why downgrade it to ‚Äúharsh questioning‚Äù and even make it sound innovative, which comes to mind as the opposite of ‚Äútraditional‚Äù? A story broadcast by On the Media this week shows that the Washington Post is not alone in this. Apparently the media is following the Obama administration‚Äôs lead.</p>
<p>I understand the administration‚Äôs position, because it is hoping this dark cloud will go away and not overshadow its policy agenda. Nonetheless, I do not understand how the administration could possibly believe that it will go away. The administration needs to get ahead of the story, even if it feels it can‚Äôt prejudice any possible criminal cases by calling it torture.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is no reason why newspapers have to toe the line on what language to use. The mere existence of definitions of what could and could not be done does not mean that the interrogation techniques used by the CIA were any less torture.</p>

			 <p>On December 28th, I began the first draft of a blog piece thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to stop thinking of terrorism as the disease and look at it instead as a symptom. In illnesses we have to treat unacceptably dangerous symptoms too, such as a high fever, but in the end we have to go to the root causes of the disease.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I never got any further with these ideas, and now, with President Obama, perhaps I don‚Äôt need to. What a difference the past few months have made!</p>
<p>Unlike the Bush administration, the Obama administration does not use the term &ldquo;Global War on Terror.&rdquo; I believe that this is not only a cosmetic change to differentiate the current administration from the previous one. Instead it constitutes recognition of the fact that terror is one part of a host of other problems, which differ according to region. The matrix of the Taliban, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, for instance, raises a rather different set of challenges than does Iraq or Iran or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even if they overlap in significant ways. Of course, the fight against terrorists will continue, but the new administration is no longer attempting to squeeze the broad set of foreign policy and security challenges it faces into the &ldquo;Global War on Terror&rdquo; rubric, which seemed to give the previous administration a bad case of tunnel vision.</p>

<p>These sobering lines making the rounds in some parts of Pakistan raise troubling questions about our use of drones to bomb extremists in that country‚Äôs tribal regions. (See Mark Mazzetti‚Äôs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/weekinreview/15MAZZETTI.html">&ldquo;The Downside of Letting Robots Do the Bombing&rdquo;</a> in today‚Äôs New York Times.) While I am not sure how to interpret them, I am reminded of how effective the rhetoric of honor was for the insurgency in Iraq, until the U.S. developed a more hands-on approach under General Petraeus. I‚Äôm not trying to make a policy suggestion, mind you. Iraq and Afghanistan are two very different places. I am simply struck by the powerful role that an injured sense of honor can play among populations that might feel like David in the face of Goliath.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôve made a little more progress in my <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2009/03/04/great-war-course.html">Great War course</a> thanks to the early deadlines for book orders. We can‚Äôt cover as many books as I might have liked because of the compressed time period: three three-hour meetings per week for one month. I can‚Äôt fill all that time with lectures either, for then the main question would be who succumbs to fatigue first, me from speaking or the students from listening. More depth and less breadth is my goal, though the reading schedule will remain rigorous.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre going to do four major units with six books. First, there will be the origins question with <em>July 1914: Soldiers, Statesmen, and the Coming of the Great War</em> by Samuel R. Williamson, Jr. and Russel Van Wyk (Bedford/St. Martin‚Äôs 2003). We‚Äôll supplement this documentary history with the first chapter of <em>The First World War</em> by Hew Strachan (Penguin 2005) Second, we will use several classes to cover the course of the global conflict using Strachan‚Äôs survey together with the personal narratives in <em>Intimate Voices from the First World War</em> by Svetlana Palmer and Sarah Wallis (HarperCollins 2005). Third, we will use Modris Eksteins‚Äô <em>Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age</em> (Anchor 1990) to consider the cultural impact of the war. Finally, we will look more closely at the war in two countries with <em>Imperial Germany and the Great War by Roger Chickering</em> (Cambridge 1998) and <em>France and the Great War</em> by Leonard V. Smith, St√©phane Audoin-Rouzeau, and Annette Becker (Cambridge 2003).</p>
<p>I might add some articles or online sources when I write the syllabus, and students will get a broader feel for the literature through brief oral book presentations at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>Because students will need a little time to begin reading in the first place, I will begin the class by looking at a selection of classic films. There could also be a lecture at the beginning on broader trends in war and society, although I‚Äôm tempted to forego that in favor of students raising related questions during discussions.</p>
<p>Incentives for students to read will be not only the subject matter and two short papers, but also a midterm and final exam. While I am no big fan of exams in history courses, many undergraduate students seem to need this carrot and stick. They might even appreciate it, though I would expect none to admit as much.</p>
<p>What happens during classroom time will depend largely on class size. The theoretical upper limit is 45, but I‚Äôm told 25 is more usual in the summer. Even that would be too large for meaningful discussions, so I‚Äôm thinking about what kind of discussions among small groups of students could occur within the larger classroom, with the groups then reporting results to the class as a whole. I have little experience with this setup in history; however, I regularly use the technique when teaching English to non-native speakers. I believe that this student-centered approach could be applied to history, in which learning historical thinking and a new topic is also about doing. Students need to read, think about, and discuss history in order to make it their own. Discussions in small groups could significantly increase the amount of practice that each student gets in a larger class.</p>
<p>Integrating these student-centered discussions into classroom time should also help with the pacing of each three-hour evening session. There will be more variety for everyone, and time usually passes more quickly for students when they are actively engaged in the class.</p>

			 <p>One small milestone: I told myself I should start walking to my current job in Arlington, and I actually did it today. I walked about a half hour downhill to Key Bridge in Georgetown. Then there was the trip up a hill in Arlington on the other side of the river. The walk in this direction was only 47 minutes, but coming back was closer to an hour, because I took a detour across Georgetown University‚Äôs campus, mistakenly believing it was a shortcut. Getting to Arlington with public transport involves two to three busses, depending on my route, so the walk didn‚Äôt cost me much extra time.

			 <p>George Mason&rsquo;s Hist 100 courses are supposed to cover Western Civilization in one semester. To manage this Sisyphean task, I switched from a chronological to a thematic approach. While this makes sense from an analytic point of view, covering themes seems to alienate some students, because the themes appear in the foreground, not the events and personalities. Moreover, the themes tend to bridge larger periods of time. With &ldquo;Religion and Society,&rdquo; for instance, I cover the Investiture Conflict, the Protestant and Catholic Reformations, the Wars of Religion, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment. And &ldquo;War and Society&rdquo; goes from the French Revolution through the Second World War into the Cold War.</p>
<p>The material in my thematic courses has been organized in a more meaningful way than was possible under a broad chronological approach, but it has not held students' attention. That is why I am thinking about covering a selection of specific episodes the next time around. I could put these up front and use the people, ideas, and issues involved as a vehicle to understand the broader themes that I want them to learn. A possible subtitle for such a course might be &ldquo;Select Events and Ideas,&rdquo; which might also make the history feel more manageable to the students.</p>

			 <p>I still need to work out the details, but here‚Äôs my catalog description for one course I am teaching this summer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hist 388-C02 - The Great War</p>
<p>Some 9 to 10 million people lost their lives in the Great War between 1914 and 1918. Most of the dead were soldiers; however, the war affected the lives of nearly everyone, not only because of the mass mourning it inspired, but also because of its economic, social, cultural and political consequences. Why did Europe‚Äôs great powers go to war? Why did they keep fighting? How did soldiers and civilians experience the war? What were its consequences? This course seeks to explore the First World War, a total war, from as many angles as possible, including politics, diplomacy, strategy, tactics, economics, class, gender, generation, and nationality. The course will center on discussions of assigned readings, which will feel heavy during this short term. We will also consider some films. Grades will be based on class participation, two short papers, a short book presentation, and a midterm and final exam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The particular challenge with this course is the intensive summer format George Mason University uses. The course meets for about three hours, three times per week for one month.</p>

			 <p>I ended the year with some political fatigue, so I have not been writing much about politics lately. Let‚Äôs face it. The campaign was a long one. I continue to be interested in politics, but I cannot be bothered to follow every little political squabble, especially not as it is currently being reported.</p>
<p>Right now each major issue appears in the media as a case of <em>the Democrats say</em> versus <em>the Republicans say,</em> and, quite frankly, I don‚Äôt really care what the Republicans are saying, not with their current tactic of doing nothing but say no in a situation where inaction is not an option. I‚Äôm more interested in learning how concrete decisions are being made, with or without the GOP. Not surprisingly then, I enjoyed Roger Simon‚Äôs opinion piece in Politico today,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090306210333/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19534.html">&ldquo;Obama‚Äôs bold.

<p>One other thing has kept me from editorializing here more of late. The sheer size and complexity of the economic and foreign policy tasks facing us defies easy answers. Fortunately, we have an administration that gets that, even as it moves forward with amazing speed.</p>

			 <p>Due to budget cuts, George Mason University did not book me ahead of time to teach history courses this semester. Hence, I took a couple more ESL courses at LADO. Of course, the History Department at Mason offered me something right before its semester started, but I was already working at LADO by that time. Saying no to LADO at the beginning of January on the mere chance of work at Mason was not an option.</p>
<p>The downside is money. Of course, that‚Äôs always an issue for teachers, but it‚Äôs particularly difficult for people teaching at private language schools. Universities pay adjunct professors by the course, which leaves financial gaps between semesters, but which also leaves time for other part-time jobs. ESL schools pay only by the hours one actually teaches, meaning five hours of actual teaching is only a ‚Äúpart-time‚Äù job, never mind preparation time.</p>
<p>Another downside is my crazy schedule. Besides teaching ESL in my DC neighborhood on Saturday mornings, as I did most of 2008, I am teaching mornings in Arlington and evenings in DC. This schedule can be a little disorienting, not to mention tiring. It has an upside too, however, insofar as it leaves me time during the day for job hunting. The trick is to switch gears between the classroom and this other side of my life, and to remember that the actual job search is the most important thing. That‚Äôs not easy for a teacher whose natural inclination is to give his classes the highest priority.</p>
<p>One practical upside to my current routine is the lack of long trips out to Fairfax. I have also been enjoying the break in my routine. Teaching ESL to students at a private language school often means the students really want to learn. They can see how the material affects their ability to interact with their environment, unlike students who take an introductory history class simply because it is mandated by the university.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also fun meeting people from so many countries. Lumping my current courses together, my students come from Mexico, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Bolivia, Brazil, Poland, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Thailand, Japan, Algeria, Libya, and Saudi Arabia. Many of them work as au pairs or nannies, and some come from the diplomatic community.</p>
<p>This summer I‚Äôm scheduled to teach Euro Civ I and II again at Georgetown University. I‚Äôve also got two history courses at George Mason University, Western Civ again and also one on the Great War. The courses at each university are intensive, but they come one after the other, so I won‚Äôt be teaching more than two intensive history courses at a time, though I might also continue with the Saturday course at LADO.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the search for a full-time job must pick up. It might be at university, but I am seriously considering history at private schools as well as possibly something that matches my skills in the government. The State Department could make sense, especially as a foreign service officer who does public diplomacy. Unfortunately, the process for getting that kind of job can take a very long time, as much as two years, if I understand correctly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, life goes on.</p>

			 <p>On Sunday, January 18th, we attempted to see the concert at Lincoln Memorial. We took a bus down Wisconsin Avenue and got off at Foggy Bottom. Walking towards the memorial, we soon joined a mass of humanity heading in the same direction.</p>
<p>There was good will and a sense of expectation in the air. Unfortunately, there was also only one hour till the concert‚Äôs begin, and we had badly underestimated the time it would take to get through security. Exacerbating the situation were people cutting the lines, sometimes willfully, sometimes because the architecture of the lines was confusing.</p>
<p>We decided to give up at 2:00, when the concert was supposed to begin. We could chock it up to experience and be better prepared on Tuesday. Besides, just seeing the expectant crowds was a good thing. We also decided to walk to Memorial Bridge via Washington Monument, thinking we could at least see the crowds‚Äîand maybe hear some sounds‚Äîacross the water. It turned out, however, that there were JumboTrons and loudspeakers at Washington Monument, no security checkpoints to go through, and the concert had not yet begun. We got within one or two hundred yards of a JumboTron and saw the whole thing from within a growing sea of humanity that reached as far back as the eye could see. The monument is on a hill, which means the crowd from my vantage point looked endless, since my view at the scene behind us reached only the monument, dropping off like the ocean does on the horizon at sea.</p>
<p>I choked up while singing the national anthem at the beginning. Catharsis. Healing after eight years of a leader who encouraged us to follow our worst instincts. The sense of joy and anticipation around me was palpable. We sang and we danced. Catharsis. Having the eighty-nine-year-old Pete Seeger there at the end made it that much sweeter‚Äîso did the whole choreography of the show, which brought not only different ethnicities on stage together, but also generations and genres. Garth Brooks‚Äô singing ‚ÄúShout!‚Äù was fine example of this tendency.</p>
<p>Afterwards we walked half of the way or more back home, though we found room in a bus for part of the trip. We talked with other passengers as if we all knew each other, which happens in DC, but seldom this easily.</p>
<p>That evening, my wife convinced me to volunteer for service the next day as Obama had been encouraging citizens to do, but my earlier hesitation meant all organized activities were already booked. So instead we signed up for a pledge drive next month for our local public radio station, which I had been planning to do anyway. And I reminded my wife of her other volunteering. She‚Äôs always been much better then me at stepping up when help is needed.</p>
<p>So Monday was a day at home. Sure, there were special events for the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday, but the next day would take a lot of energy and planning.</p>
<p>Told we had to choose between inauguration and the parade, and told the parade had security checkpoints, but a spot on the Mall for inauguration didn‚Äôt, the choice was easy. Moreover, being there was more important than having a chance to see Obama in the parade. What better way to bear witness than with two million people?</p>
<p>The decision to brave the crowds was easier, because we live in Glover Park, which is close enough to make it possible to avoid packed Metro stations.</p>
<p>This morning we took a bus to Dupont Circle and walked to Washington Monument. We left the apartment at 8:00 and had a spot with a view of a JumboTron by 9:00. They rebroadcast the concert to distract us, and they showed us the arriving guests. The wait passed by pretty quickly this way.</p>
<p>Our long-johns and other layers kept us reasonably comfortable. So did a folded yoga mat (for both sitting and standing on) and snacks and tea. The more crowded it got, the less the wind bit into us, though the breeze never completely went away on that small hill.</p>
<p>The mood reminded me of the Sunday concert, except we got past the anticipation to the main event. At times it felt like at a church, as some neighbors from Newport News responded to parts of the president‚Äôs speech with a rhythmic refrain of ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù as if in a conversation with him. An ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù even slipped from my lips a couple times, including at the part where Obama denounced the false choice between security and our values. I was doubly impressed then when that Obama line drew a lot of extra cheers and applause where we were standing.</p>
<p>There will be more to ponder in the coming days and weeks. Right now I am exhausted from the cold and windy, but beautiful walk back from Washington Monument across to Lincoln Memorial, along the Potomac to Georgetown, and up Wisconsin Avenue to Glover Park. (Were we ever stiff after a short bathroom break at Barnes &amp; Noble in Georgetown and then coffee at a small cafe on Wisconsin Avenue!)</p>
<p>Tired, beat, exhausted‚Äîthe good kind.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Juan Cole offers some interesting historical perspective on Israel&rsquo;s wars in a piece called &ldquo;Gaza 2008: Micro-Wars and Macro-Wars.&rdquo; Here is one of his more provocative assessments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s political tradition seeks expansion if possible; if not possible, it seeks a balance of power with its enemies. If that is not possible, it seeks to be held harmless from its avowed foes. If that is not possible, it is willing to wage total war to punish the enemy population until it accepts at least a cold peace. Where necessary, Israel is willing to give up territorial expansion to get the cold peace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If only I knew what &ldquo;total war&rdquo; means here. In modern European history it was when the distinction between soldiers and civilians was increasingly erased during the First and Second World Wars. If Israel sometimes erases such distinctions in urban situations, I am not aware of a policy that accepts this erasure, especially not for its own civilians. Presumably Cole has something else in mind or is using hyperbole, either way demonstrating how slippery the term &ldquo;total war&rdquo; can be.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;cold peace&rdquo;? Well, the Cold War was a rhetorical war in the metropoles and a shooting war in other countries by proxy; however, it was otherwise a peace, albeit one punctuated by extreme levels of militarization that the push of a button could have transformed into the first real total war. Perhaps then &ldquo;cold war&rdquo; in a generic sense means a war with no shooting. Does &ldquo;cold peace&rdquo; mean a peace marked by periodic violence? If so, I have not noticed any particular willingness by Israel to accept this violence. Or is this about an icy peace punctuated by the permanent threat of violence? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a cold war then?</p>
<p>Putting aside the overly generous use of unexplained labels, Cole&rsquo;s article is worth reading, whether or not you agree with his take on &ldquo;Israel&rsquo;s old expansionist tendencies.&rdquo; The historical context is useful, and the term &ldquo;micro-wars&rdquo; is at least consistent with the metaphor upon which &ldquo;asymmetric war&rdquo; depends, though it encompasses more dimensions than merely partisan warfare. Cole points to four specific factors in the twenty-first century: (1) the integration of the religious political parties Hamas and Hizbullah with the population around them via the parties' social services; (2) suicide bombs, tank-piercing capabilities, and small rocket fire; (3) the support of a regional power (a common feature of other guerilla wars); and (4) &ldquo;Israel&rsquo;s Achilles heel, its demographic vulnerability&rdquo;‚Äîa violent environment encourages emigration. Cole uses these factors as the backdrop for his narrative of Israel&rsquo;s conflicts in Southern Lebanon and Gaza.</p>
<p>In the end, though, he wonders if global opinion might prove a bigger problem for Israel, albeit only in the long term. Public opinion is the one thing I&rsquo;ve been wondering about as well.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;macro-war&rdquo;? Does Cole mean the old conventional wars that Israel used to fight with its neighbors? Or is he talking about global public opinion, which is the focus of Israel&rsquo;s and its enemies' propaganda wars and public diplomacy?</p>

			 <p>I just cooked some bok choy and something similar whose name I don‚Äôt know. I won‚Äôt be eating these greens tonight, but they were getting old and needed cooking. I used more water than was probably necessary, which left me with some good stock for a soup. Tonight, however, was one of those nights when the stock didn‚Äôt get saved. Instead I just drank it. It is amazing how much flavor goes into the water. Presumably some nutrients are in there too, though I was just in it for the flavor and warmth.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm pretty simple when it comes to things like this. Maybe sometime I‚Äôll look for recipes, but usually the food from my farm share tastes good without doing more than cooking up vegetables and potatoes or rice, or maybe making a soup out of what is on hand. This afternoon I did that with some white turnips, carrots, Brussels sprouts, an onion, a potato, and some homemade noodles from my CSA. I used some vegetarian bouillon from Rapunzel too, since I am not methodical enough with saving vegetable stock. I have found, however, that the vegetables from my CSA have so much flavor that I need much less bouillon than usual, one half to a third of what the directions call for.</p>

			 <p>It‚Äôs the end of a long day, or rather the beginning of a new one, if the passing of midnight means anything. Two squash pies are doing their thing in the oven. These were long in the making. I washed a bunch of dishes and cooked the squash this morning. Usually I make the pies for Thanksgiving with canned pumpkin, but we had the biodynamic squash from our farm share, so I did it the old-fashioned way. This included washing and laying out the seeds to dry. (They‚Äôll make a good snack.) Afterwards, I did my weekly food run to Bethesda, where my CSA is. This evening I filled in for someone at LADO, where I‚Äôm teaching English to non-native speakers. Then I came back home, took a break, and began converting the cooked squash into two pies. I have leftover pie mixture too, so I‚Äôll make more tomorrow or Friday.</p>
<p>In case you‚Äôre wondering, I used a recipe called Dolly‚Äôs Pumpkin Pie in Uprisings: The Whole Grain Bakers‚Äô Book (p. 199). This is the same book that taught me how to <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2008/01/15/baking-bread.html">bake whole grain bread</a>.</p>

			 <p>People who ride busses have to spend time waiting. I often use the time to think or read, but sometimes I observe the world around me while allowing myself simply to be. And sometimes I pull out a notepad and write down my thoughts.</p>
<p>The sun has started shining differently in the morning and evening. It‚Äôs lower in the sky, and it lends a different light to the objects it touches. The colors change, as if they were in pictures printed from slides. (What was the name of that process, when we made pictures from slides, which were basically the opposite of negatives?)</p>
<p>When the sunlight is like this, it becomes a pleasure to let it shine into my eyes as I almost‚Äîbut not quite‚Äîlook into it. It carries something that my being craves, the stuff of good moods and a friendly disposition, which can too easily go into hiding when days grow shorter and the nights longer. (How do people survive without the sun in the far north?) During much of the year I go out of my way to be in the shade, but this sun is different. It will disappear soon, giving way to the cold wind and darkness, but not before it has given me the strength I need for a journey in the cold tonight, after the warm feeling and my memory of it have passed.</p>

			 <p>I had high hopes for today. I had no grading to do or lecture to prepare. I could take off my teaching hat and devote the day to a lot of pressing personal business, especially job applications. But I was nearly immobile for much of the day. Why? It‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt taught long evening classes before, I thought. But then I did the math. This is the first semester I have taught a daytime class and a long evening class. That in itself might be unremarkable, but then there‚Äôs the commute too. So maybe I should not feel guilty about Thursdays and just accept that at the moment it is my weekend. After all, I spent last weekend grading, and that will happen next weekend too. And I am teaching English as a Foreign Language on Saturdays to a group of au pairs at a school in my neighborhood called LADO.</p>
<p>But back to that math. Yesterday I got up at 7:00 and left the house a little after 9:00. The commute by bus and train and bus is 90 minutes on a good day, though usually a little longer. I lectured from 11:30 to 12:20. I advised students on an upcoming project for the next hour. I had lunch and caught up on the news via the web. Then I updated Blackboard, the online learning system that George Mason University uses. I returned to the office at 5:00, an hour earlier than usual, because I figured I‚Äôd have more visitors than usual, which I did, right down to 7:10. At that point I had to quit advising students and deliver a lecture beginning at 7:20. I managed to end that early, that is, at 9:50, and then I answered student questions until 10:15. I caught a bus at 10:30. Waited 15 minutes for a train. Got into DC about 11:30 and waited for a bus. I got home about midnight. That‚Äôs 15 hours on the move. And it really is on the move, because adjunct professors at Mason only have access to office space for office hours. There is not enough room to give us a work space too.</p>
<p>So maybe it‚Äôs okay to be exhausted on Thursday, which really is my weekend this semester. One good thing: I‚Äôve been able to ride the train during non-peak hours. Another: I‚Äôve started doing yoga again, and I intend to keep that up, regardless of whatever crazy work schedule I might have in future.</p>

			 <p>Today is Veterans Day in the United States. Today also marks the ninetieth anniversary of the end of the Great War, in which 9 to 10 million soldiers died. To make that more comprehensible, try 1,303 German soldiers per day on average. By way of comparison, Americans lost 123 soldiers daily on average during the Second World War.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The numbers are even more startling when all casualties&mdash;killed and wounded&mdash;are considered for the First World War: 12.4% of the prewar male population in the United Kingdom, 16.1% for France, 19.3% for Germany, 25.2% for Austria-Hungary, and 6.9% for Russia. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> If it sounds like Russia got off easy by comparison, remember that this war touched off the Bolshevik Revolution, which brought civil war, famine, and Stalin.</p>

<p>There is a great tradition of paint-peeling political hyperbole during presidential campaign years. And there is an equally great tradition of backing off from it all afterward, though with varying degrees of deftness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But given the intensity of some of the charges that have been made in the past few months, and the historic nature of Mr. Obama‚Äôs election, the exercise this year has been particularly whiplash-inducing, with its extreme before-and-after contrasts.</p>

			 <p>After election night, a few hours‚Äô sleep, and a fourteen-hour Wednesday (not including the late-night trip home from work I‚Äôm now on), I‚Äôm too tired to write a fresh blog post. Nonetheless, I‚Äôd like to share some of my impressions from election night shortly after McCain‚Äôs and Obama‚Äôs speeches. Here are two comments I wrote at one online forum. The first was on a thread from a guy convinced that Obama is really a socialist. The other was on an upbeat thread asking what Obama‚Äôs election meant for America. I share them here, because maybe at some point I will want to remember what I was thinking on that first night.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>McCain gave an excellent speech tonight. I hope all his supporters listen to it closely. I hope they listen to Obama‚Äôs too. New chapter, folks. Time to roll up the sleeves and get to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Obama gave a good speech yesterday that pointed to the tough challenges ahead of us. Instead of triumphalism he talked about the long road ahead. This attitude was clear from his voice and body language too. This is the kind of leadership I have been hoping for. No promises of fast and easy solutions. Just hard work for all of us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the campaign is over, and I can start thinking about other things again, like making a living.</p>

			 <p>A lot of people get angry or sad or both on 9/11. Of course, the loss of life in this country was horrible, but for me that date always brings up the manner in which Bush used Americans' sentiments to go to war against a country that had nothing to do with the attack, Iraq. And in this political season, it brings to mind how McCain was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080912063240/http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=13&amp;prgDate=9-4-2008">ahead of the curve</a> in calling for that war.</p>
<p>Call these sentiments mean-spirited, if you will. How dare I politick on this day of remembrance? Fair enough, but these sentiments have been with me for many years now. They are part of my 9/11, just as are the worries about friends in New York, the story of a colleague&rsquo;s husband who missed work that day and whose general was killed in the Pentagon office my colleague&rsquo;s husband usually also occupied, the tales told by people in my building streaming in from downtown reporting alleged bombs in cars around the city, the military helicopters and jets over the skies of DC and the absence of the usual noisy commercial airliners, a child sick at home and a wife working downtown, the activation of a friend in the DC National Guard for years of active duty in this city and Afghanistan, the quiet evening streets for weeks after the attack, the sudden departure of Arab students from my building because their parents back home feared for their safety, the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, the color-coded warnings, and the never-ending rhetoric and politics of fear.</p>
<p>Or talk about hindsight being twenty-twenty. Thing is, Bush didn&rsquo;t need hindsight. All he and his advisors needed was a sense of how countries have reacted to attacks in the past. As a historian, I claim no special insights into the future, but I frequently have a fair idea of what we should be paying attention to in the present. I&rsquo;m good at asking questions, even if my answers aren&rsquo;t always right. Here&rsquo;s what I told my shaken students in Washington, DC <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2007/09/11/six-years-ago.html">seven years ago</a>. And still we don&rsquo;t teach war and society as a fundamental aspect of the human experience in required undergraduate history courses. What a shame.</p>

			 <p>I can take the Republican crowd in Dayton on Friday chanting the name of their candidate enthusiastically (00:00 of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080905171722/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKByFPy7-RU">C-SPAN video</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JOHN MC CAIN<br>
JOHN MC CAIN<br>
JOHN MC CAIN</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I find it uncanny when the same crowd slips into a chant about the United States, eliding one three-syllable chant into another, the candidate into the country (23:00).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>U S A<br>
U S A<br>
U S A</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The aggressive tone is no different than the one many Americans use at the Olympics, a tone they consider harmless, because they don&rsquo;t suffer from any concerns about the public image of the Loud American overseas. Only this wasn&rsquo;t abroad, so there was no need to assert the supposed physical superiority of Americans in such a confrontational way, unless I were to interpret the chanting as support for John McCain&rsquo;s bellicose foreign policy rhetoric, which it was (21:48).</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t also help but feel that it was aimed at Democrats, who these people don&rsquo;t see as real Americans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>U S A<br>
U S A<br>
U S A</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John McCain stood there and beamed, as if acknowledging his and his supporters' open secret: only Republicans love their country. Of course, that statement is only true if patriotism equals bellicosity. But it doesn&rsquo;t. McCain would be a better man if he would acknowledge the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080905171722/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94087570">following statement</a> by Barack Obama. But he won&rsquo;t.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>. . . Let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a red America or a blue America &ndash; they have served the United States of America.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It takes a true patriot to acknowledge the humanity in and ideals of one&rsquo;s political opponent</p>

			 <p>It is Labor Day in these United States of America. Observing this holiday became a bittersweet experience this morning, when Latin American workers showed up to take care of the garden outside my building, as if Labor Day was not for them too. On the other hand, allowing or forcing workers to observe this holiday would hurt them financially, because they would not be paid, just as millions of unorganized American workers are not being paid today. This circumstance is due in part to the weakness of organized labor in this country. Today I am also reminded of how most American media outlets treat news of Wall Street&rsquo;s welfare as a story about the general interest but news of organized labor as a special interest. Even worse, far too many American workers have internalized this way of thinking.</p>
<p>By the way, did you know that most of the world celebrates this day on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080905171722/http://clioandme.wordpress.com/2008/05/01/happy-may-day/">May 1st</a>? I guess the internationalist and socialist connotations of that day were too much for this country.</p>

			 <p>Watching a video from near the end of the Cold War, I was reminded of a short post I wrote last summer about a shiny new image of Stalin in a Russian textbook. Looking back, the material in this piece, <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2007/08/13/good-old-stalin.html">Good Old Stalin</a>, seems a little too relevant. Putin is not Stalin, and we are not in a Cold War, but unabashed admiration for authoritarian rule and brute force is not a good thing to be teaching high school students, unless, of course, you plan on using such methods to rule your country.</p>

			 <p>At the beginning of the week I suggested that Russia might have learned a lesson from the American invasion of Iraq.[^1] One lesson that Russia clearly did not learn was the importance of world opinion. The Bush administration paid a high price for thumbing its nose at allies and friends who opposed the invasion. It did not believe in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080503230522/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=7059">soft power</a>, but its significant diminution was real nonetheless. Russia‚Äôs actions will cost it dearly if it continues to allow its armored vehicles to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081209071041/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/16/world/europe/16armored.html">rumble around Georgia</a>, far away from South Ossetia. Remember that breakaway province? Wasn‚Äôt defending it Russia‚Äôs casus belli? Sometimes states have to ignore international opinion, but it is important to balance whatever one hopes thereby to gain against what one is going to lose. Russia has more to lose because of its pugnacious behavior than it thinks. It might believe that its interests lie in observing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081005230327/http://www.rightcommentary.com/2008/08/15/why-georgia-matters/">&ldquo;jail house yard&rdquo;</a> code of behavior, and following this model might net it some short-term gains; however, in the long run it will lose more than it can gain. Naked force is a poor substitute for hearts and minds. It is an even worse substitute if those hearts and minds stand behind an opposing force. Hubris is a dangerous thing, Mr. Putin. That‚Äôs the real lesson of Iraq.</p>

<p>Too often I come across an interesting piece of information on a blog that does not contain links to the author‚Äôs sources. That‚Äôs too bad. All I can do at that point is shrug my shoulders and wonder if the story is true. Then I‚Äôll probably close that browser tab and go somewhere else, because I won‚Äôt risk experiencing similar frustration with a second story on the same blog. Of course, if the story is really important to me, I can do further research on Google, which is fair enough. At the same time, though, what reason have you given me to go back to your blog? None. Offer me a good, well sourced post, though, and I will be back. Links to your sources are important for at least four reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verifiability. Links to your sources allow me to verify whether or not your story is true. For this to work, though, they should point to hard news sources, not just another blog. Bobbie Sullivan does this on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aircrew Buzz<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and her other aviation blogs.</li>
<li>Acknowledgment. Sources permit you to acknowledge where you got your ideas and information from in the first place. These can include not only hard news sources, but also any blog or other source that sparked you to think about the topic. If the information is not generally known, though, include additional sources to satisfy the verifiability requirement. I sometimes handle acknowledgments with a hat tip. You can see one Gavin Robinson gave me in the first paragraph of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->14th Military History Carnival<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</li>
<li>Examples. Sources can help provide you with the kinds of examples you need to support your arguments. Since the internet is a hypertext environment, sources can also help you to pack more information into a post without providing loads of background details. I used links in this manner in the second paragraph of a post about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->generational differences<!-- raw HTML omitted --> between Barack Obama and Jeremiah Wright. I‚Äôm also linking examples in this post about sources.</li>
<li>Context. Sources help locate your ideas within their broader context. By providing links to that context, you help your reader to understand how your ideas relate to other opinions and discussions on the internet, and on your own blog. In the process you provide additional value to your reader, giving her one more reason to return. One blogger who often provides good context through linked sources is Rich Becker of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Copywrite. Ink.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, not all blog posts need sources. If you are writing about your own life, you are the acknowledged expert on it. Enough said. And no one who has heard <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tony Hogan‚Äôs music<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is going to ask him to provide sources for the advice he offers on learning the guitar. It helps, though, that he has a good <!-- raw HTML omitted -->about page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on his blog, which tells us a bit more about him. And what about me? Why do I think I can offer this advice without providing sources on the art of sourcing? My field is history, and getting students to understand the value of sources is one of my everyday teaching concerns. Yes, I could be making this up, but you can find out more about me at Clio and Me.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

			 <p>The Washington, DC International <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080509121956/http://www.filmfestdc.org/">Film Festival</a> has been around for twenty-two years now, but this is the first time I‚Äôve actually attended. Usually I‚Äôm too swamped by end-of-the-semester grading. This was true of this year too, but my wife wasn‚Äôt accepting that excuse, and I‚Äôm glad. We managed to see four films this week: ‚ÄúEgg‚Äù [Yumurta] (Semih Kaplanoglu, Turkey/Greece, 2007), ‚ÄúTricks‚Äù [Sztuczki] (Andrzej Jakimowski, Poland, 2007), ‚ÄúThe Edge of Heaven‚Äù [Auf der anderen Seite] (Fatih Akin, Germany/Turkey, 2007), and ‚ÄúWith Your Permission‚Äù [Til Doden os Skiller] (Paprika Steen, Sweden/Denmark, 2007).</p>
<p>Our favorite movies were ‚ÄúEgg‚Äù and ‚ÄúTricks,‚Äù both of which contained not only humor, but a certain magical quality, where time and stress were suspended. As much happened in the people‚Äôs faces and as in their words. In ‚ÄúEgg‚Äù the looks passed between a man who returned to his hometown to bury his mother and the young woman who had taken care of his mother. In ‚ÄúTricks‚Äù the looks passed between a young boy and his teenage sister, as well as between the boy and the man he was sure was his father. There was also a lot of movement in ‚ÄúTricks‚Äù as the boy explored and played around the train station and town, though most of these actions were part of everyday life, not a dramatic sequence of events. I enjoyed getting lost in the worlds these two films offered.</p>
<p>We wanted to see ‚ÄúThe Edge of Heaven‚Äù, because we had enjoyed an extremely funny movie by the same directory called ‚ÄúKebab Connection.‚Äù We knew this movie wasn‚Äôt going to be funny, but I was surprised by the unpleasant turns of fate mixed with occasional joy and life‚Äôs refusal to stop moving on. It could have been an excellent, if sometimes confusing movie, had not the distributors sent the film to the theater with the reels in the wrong order. Instead of seeing the movie‚Äôs three parts in the correct order, we saw the middle, then the beginning, then the end. If it had to happen, I suppose this was the movie where it would do the least damage, but it was still disappointing. As it was, I got the story and simple slices of life from Germany and Turkey, but much of the overarching story was lost on me. Afterwards I ended up focusing my attention not on the message, but on trying to re-imagine the film in the correct order. Still not there yet.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith Your Permission‚Äù is a worthwhile dark comedy with an operatic emotional high point. I‚Äôm glad I saw it, but it was not in the same league with the first two magical films I saw. Nor was it intended to be, I think. It begins with a man who has a black eye from his wife. She beats him more than once and he acts increasingly strange. His boss on the ferry makes him seek help. Unusual twists in the plot with some hilarious characters follow on the way to an emotionally satisfying result.</p>
<p>I would also like to mention one of the many films we wanted to see but couldn‚Äôt. We had time to see ‚ÄúJazz in the Diamond District‚Äù (Lindsey Christian, USA, 2007), but it was sold out and shown only once. Oh well. I hope it gets more play here in DC. It‚Äôs not in the same league as the other films I saw this week, but it is about real people who live in my city, not the politicians.

			 <p>Times might have changed, but it seems that some didn‚Äôt get the memo. It would be nice if Reverend Jeremiah Wright would trust the next generation, embodied by Senator Barack Obama, to do things its way, instead of clinging to his own experiences and ignoring the great changes that this society has undergone. Why is he trying so hard to wreck the Obama campaign anyway? Maybe he doesn‚Äôt believe a black man can get elected and now he is in the business of creating a self-fulfilling prophesy? I dunno.</p>
<p>What I do know is that someone else from his earlier generation is also out of touch with what leaders like Obama are saying. Listen to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080430174356/http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/04252008/profile.html">Bill Moyer‚Äôs interview with Wright</a>, and you will see Moyers feeling very much at ease with the man. Moyers (born in 1934) is a little older than Wright (born in 1941), but both experienced the Johnson administration and the Civil Rights Movement as young men. I respect their experiences and enjoy hearing their thoughts on where America is at. I also enjoyed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080505040723/http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/03282008/profile.html">Moyer‚Äôs conversation with Fred Harris</a> (born in 1930), the only surviving member of the Kerner Commission, which reported on the racism underlying the social inequality that had helped set off the race riots after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968. The thing about Moyers‚Äô and Harris‚Äô conversation that stood out most for me, however, was that it appeared on the show right after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080505040723/http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/03282008/profile2.html">Moyer‚Äôs conversation with Mayer Cory Booker</a> of Newark. Booker (born in 1969) did not speak the language of race and anger. Like Obama (born in 1961), he is very much about members of the community doing what they can to move forward. Watch the video and you‚Äôll understand what I mean. (You‚Äôll also maybe want to see him on the national stage at some point.) Watch too how Moyers is almost mystified by Booker‚Äôs perspective, one Obama shares. Moyers expects to see righteous anger in Booker. He wants Booker to blame all of Newark‚Äôs woes on racism and demand assistance from the federal government, but Booker refuses to follow that path. This conversation made clear to me that a vast gulf separates my generation (I am forty-five) from Moyers‚Äô. It also made me glad that leaders such as Obama and Booker are out there.</p>
<p>Obama understands the differences between the experiences of his generation and those of Wright‚Äôs. Wright might too, but he seems unwilling to trust the next generation to do the right thing. Instead he is out there doing what he seems to feel is truth-telling, that is, trying to wreck the very real chances that a former member of his congregation has to become the next president. Yet if he has done his job as the pastor of his congregation, he can trust those he helped bring up in his church to do the right thing. Time to let go, Reverend Wright, and give Senator Obama a chance to do it his way.</p>
<p>Yet Wright seems trapped in the experiences of his own generation. He seems unable to acknowledge that Obama‚Äôs generation has undergone a different set of experiences. He also thinks in unhistorical terms. As a historian I grew dizzy listening to him jump back and forth across the centuries and millennia, as if injustices here and there were all part of the same unchanging story. Thus I cringed when he called himself a historian of religion at one point in his conversation with Moyers. He knows more than I ever will about the subject, but he was not <a href="https://markstoneman.com/2008/03/14/fostering-historical-thinking.html">thinking historically</a>. He could not move across different times and imagine that each period involved different mentalities and experiences. For him it was all one story with one set of values. Thus, he seems to differ from Obama not just in generational terms, but also in terms of the philosophy of history that underlies his worldview. Obama‚Äôs major speech on race was keenly aware of the passage of time and its impact on people living in it.

			 <p>Last October, in connection with the bad news about Blackwater coming out, I made the following remarks on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080503005936/http://clioandme.wordpress.com/2007/10/08/outsourcing-military-tasks/">Clio and Me</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of President Bush‚Äôs mistakes was to go to war with only enough public support to begin it. There is no such thing as war on the cheap. Private contractors are expensive in mere dollars, but they have helped the administration to avoid seeking a more solid domestic political foundation for the war‚Äîor accepting the consequences if it is unable to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I stand by those remarks, but a piece in Sunday‚Äôs <em>New York Times</em> points to more sophisticated Pentagon management of the media than I had believed possible. In &ldquo;Behind Analysts, the Pentagon‚Äôs Hidden Hand,&rdquo; <a href="https://archive.ph/rFAz5">David Barstow reports</a> on the Pentagon‚Äôs active courtship of so-called independent military analysts on the major television news networks. The analysts were seduced not only by the flattering attention by the Pentagon and the fees paid by the media, but also by the financial opportunities that their access to the Pentagon provided because of their ties to companies seeking military contracts.</p>
<p>On my tumblelog I was only half-joking when earlier this evening I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One more reason to watch The News Hour on PBS instead. So what is this now? The military-industrial-media complex? Or is everything okay since this has been stage-managed by our duly elected president‚Äôs appointed cronies?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, propaganda or ‚Äúpsyops‚Äù [psychological operations] will only get the administration and Pentagon so far.</p>

			 <p>We get most of our fruit and vegetables through a local cooperative called a CSA, which stands for Community Supported Agriculture. Unlike a typical buying cooperative though, a CSA also works to support the producers of food, often one farmer. It binds producers and consumers together, so that producers know they have a certain income, and consumers get more or less food, depending on how things are going.</p>
<p>The one to which my wife and I belong is called Spiritual Food CSA. It supports biodynamic farming, which practices more stringent standards than regular organic farming, though I don‚Äôt know all the details. The word spiritual comes in, because the CSA is organized by a local yoga ashram, for whom healthy food, a healthy earth, healthy people, and a healthy spiritual life are inseparable. At least that‚Äôs what I think it means. I don‚Äôt get into the spiritual side of things, but I like taking yoga, and the people at the Shanti Yoga Ashram are just plain good folk. If only I had time for yoga right now. My commute from Northwest DC to Fairfax, VA and my teaching schedule has been keeping me away. Must change that.</p>
<p>Anyway, we pay one price for half a year and then pick up a share of food every week. Apples from the fall harvest had been accumulating in my fridge, as had oranges, which the CSA gets direct from Florida. Today, I decided to take action. I dug out the old juice maker and made orange juice and apple juice. I also made a large glass of apple sauce. Yum!</p>

<p>The success of this discussion was also due in part to another issue. I have begun to &ldquo;legitimate confusion&rdquo; for my students,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that is, I have begun to cultivate an awareness in them of just how hard historical interpretation can be and how important learning how to ask questions can be. With this attitude, students can explore sources and ideas honestly and thoughtfully without fear of getting it wrong and looking bad. With such an awareness, students were willing to attempt the leaps of imagination necessary to navigate among three different time periods, the early twenty-first century, the nineteen thirties and forties, and the first few decades of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>I might try this book again, though I could also do with a change. Perhaps some of you have some ideas?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I‚Äôve started reading Thomas Pynchon‚Äôs, <em>Against the Day</em>. I enjoy Pynchon, though there‚Äôs no guarantee I‚Äôll be able to say anything meaningful about his novel because his narratives are often difficult to follow. Take, for instance, the cryptic but thought-provoking quote from Thelonius Monk at the beginning of the book: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always night, or we wouldn‚Äôt need light.‚Äù</p>
<p>This novel is set at the turn of the previous century, beginning with the Columbian World‚Äôs Fair in 1893 and running past the First World War. As usual, Pynchon sometimes seems to play fast and loose with historical facts, so it doesn‚Äôt feel like historical fiction in any traditional sense. That‚Äôs not a criticism, mind you, just something to keep in mind when reading it.</p>
<p>Maybe I will have to make use of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418021935/http://pynchonwiki.com/">Thomas Pynchon Wiki</a>, which I just discovered. And maybe, just maybe, I‚Äôll check out some of the many reviews on the novel, though I don‚Äôt want to spoil it for myself, especially since I find my tastes are often out of sync with those of the reviewers.</p>
<p>One practical thing I like: with 1085 pages, this $18.00 paperback is a relative bargain; it‚Äôs going to keep me busy for a long time.</p>
<p>Perhaps after that I‚Äôll go back and look at some of his earlier stuff. I read <em>Vineland</em> when it came out in paperback, but I hadn‚Äôt touched Pynchon before that since I was maybe only twenty-one. I read <em>Gravity‚Äôs Rainbow</em>, for instance, while in the field artillery on maneuver in Grafenw√∂hr, Germany. I still remember clinging to the book while bouncing up and down and eating dust on dirt roads on the back of a self-propelled eight-inch howitzer.</p>

			 <p>In his 1998 survey of human history, The Way of the World, David Fromkin writes of Prohibition in the United States thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The experiment proved to be a disaster. Human nature resisted it. The inability of the government to enforce the laws against alcohol brought about a general collapse of law and order in such cities as Chicago in the 1920s. In the 1930s the law and the constitutional amendment were repealed, and order was restored. (215)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This observation reminds me of both drug policy and immigration policy in the United States. We legislate social change and then are surprised when it doesn‚Äôt occur or law and order come under threat. Fromkin is on to something when he writes, ‚ÄúProhibition was an extreme symptom of a general American view that anything can be changed by passing a law, a view that ignores rooted realities of human nature‚Äù (215). This idealism is also evident in our foreign policy.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, we used to criticize the Soviet Union for its utopian attempt to remake human nature as it strove to realize the Communist dreams of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. While it took some American idealism to overcome the Soviet threat, it also took hard-nosed realism. Where would we be now if we had decided to turn the Cold War into a shooting war in the name of an idea called democracy?</p>

			 <p>My wife has had a handful of volumes from Alexander McCall Smith‚Äôs wonderful private detective series set in Botswana. I had long wanted to get going on them, but she had loaned out the first volume and we don‚Äôt know who has it. Last week I was pleased to find a copy of the first volume in our laundry room, where people in my building sometimes deposit unwanted books. I am so glad I began reading it. I was hoping for detective stories with a harder edge, but that didn‚Äôt happen. Instead I got something better. The main character, Mma Precious Ramotswe, ‚Äúa traditionally built woman,‚Äù is the most likeable character I‚Äôve encountered in years. She‚Äôs a real woman with real problems, but with rare strength and courage, as well as a fine zest for life. This sounds like a cliche, but I am loathe to go into details for fear of spoiling plots. You can find out more on the author‚Äôs website, if you want.</p>
<p>I am almost done with the fourth. Now I have to take a break again, because we‚Äôre missing the fifth and sixth, and I don‚Äôt want to go straight to the seventh, which we have. Apparently there‚Äôs an eighth out now too.</p>
<p>By the way, I enjoy reading mysteries not just for the mystery, but for the milieu they usually reveal to me. Indeed, these books would have been a disappointment if mystery was all I had wanted. The stories are all about the characters and their world in Botswana. Along the way Mma Ramotswe and her assistant, Mma Makutsi, deal with a variety of cases and moral questions.</p>

			 <p>Well, BlogCatalog has finally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080305040422/http://www.blogcatalog.com/discuss/entry/the-removal-of-religious-topics-from-blogcatalog-discussions">banned</a> religious and anti-religious discussions from their main forums. I say <em>finally</em>, because those discussions have made the place more than a little unpleasant at times over the past year. People are still free to take advantage of BlogCatalog‚Äôs group feature, however, and talk about whatever they want there.</p>
<p>I believe that life online is akin to life in the physical world, and that the rules of civil discourse that I learned before the internet existed should still apply. To me this includes the stricture in everyday life on talking about religion in groups where there are a variety of sensibilities but little or no common purpose. No good can come from such a group slugging it out over whether God exists or not, what Christianity really means, and so on‚Äînot in a public space where anyone can join in.</p>
<p>My students have been able to talk about religion and society on a wiki I set up for my Western Civilization course this semester, but that‚Äôs different. There the students have a common purpose, and I‚Äôve only needed to remind them of it a couple times.</p>

			 <p>Hillary Clinton likes to talk about her years of experience and how she will be ready for office from day one, should she win the Democratic nomination and then make it all the way to the White House. If she wins the nomination, I‚Äôll vote for her, but I‚Äôm not buying the argument that Obama has not demonstrated some good leadership skills. Take, for instance, his and Clinton‚Äôs respective presidential campaigns, which are non-trivial operations. Obama emerged from Super Tuesday in a dead heat with Clinton and then managed to bring about an impressive string of consecutive wins. Clinton, by contrast, has slipped. In Friday‚Äôs Christian Science Monitor, Linda Feldmann <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080310222244/http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0222/p01s05-uspo.html">writes</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What happened? On Clinton‚Äôs part, her straits represent a massive failure of planning and organization, analysts say. Her campaign operated on the assumption she would have the nomination effectively locked up with the 22 contests on Feb. 5, and it spent accordingly. The lack of a Plan B has left her scrambling for cash and organizing late in the post-Super Tuesday contests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This situation says something significant about Clinton‚Äôs and Obama‚Äôs respective leadership skills. Now if only Michelle Obama would stop saying that her husband is the first reason she ever had to be proud of her country.</p>

			 <p>My son, who is in the eleventh grade, has long supported Senator Obama, but now he is even making phone calls on behalf of the Obama campaign. It does my heart good to see youth get excited and even hopeful about politics in this way. Sure, my son didn‚Äôt grow up on Watergate and defeat in Vietnam, as I did, but his generation was exposed to other things that could be expected to cause cynicism, namely the scandals surrounding Clinton‚Äôs sex life and Congress‚Äôs ridiculous decision to impeach him. The way that Bush came to the White House the first time or the U.S. started the war in Iraq could also be expected to make youth feel cynical and powerless. Instead though, there are people like my son who have decided that cynicism has no place in their lives or this country‚Äôs political future. Good for them.</p>

			 <p>We were out of bread, and my wife asked me if I would bake some. It had been a while, so I said yes. Now three small loaves of whole-grain wheat bread are rising on a cookie sheet with a clean thin cotton towel over them. They look beautiful too. If only I had a camera! Of course, then I‚Äôd also have to know how to use it. Food photography, I suspect, is not easy.</p>
<p>The bread contains whole-grain wheat flour, yeast, water, barley syrup, oil, and salt. Simple, healthy ingredients. Also good was all the kneading. There‚Äôs something satisfying about that. The bread tastes twice as good when I make it myself, maybe because it is part of a more authentic experience than going to the store represents.</p>
<p>One thing I would do, if I had my druthers, would be to grind the flour fresh from wheat berries. But we don‚Äôt have a mill like we used to when we were living in Augsburg, Germany back in the early 1990s. Also, wheat berries are expensive and not available here in DC in large quantities. In Augsburg my wife drove with a friend out to a farmer to buy sacks of grain‚Äîwheat, spelt, rye, barley, millet, and Gr√ºnkern (spelt harvested while only half ripe and then roasted). We ground the grain as we needed it with a little electric mill. We milled fine flour for baking or course stuff for cooking entrees of various kinds.</p>
<p>Now the bread‚Äôs in the oven.</p>
<p>Baking bread requires several periods of waiting. First I had to wait for the water and yeast mixture to bubble. During that time I made supper. Then I had to wait for the dough I made rise. During that time I made some whole grain ginger cookies. Then I punched down the dough, made the loaves and had to let them rise. Washed dishes, listened to the news, and began some blogging. Forty-five more minutes till nirvana.</p>
<p>I used to bake a great deal more, and then I went years without doing it. I started again last winter, but the heat in the summer put me off it. Well, winter‚Äôs here again, so a hot kitchen feels good.</p>

Engst of Tidbits <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080312091319/http://db.tidbits.com/article/9360">reports</a> that Google is talking about creating an alternative to Wikipedia in which each page or ‚Äúknol‚Äù is controlled by one author. The idea is to give Google a chance at reaching the first spot in its own search results so it can serve ads on that page. Like Engst, I‚Äôm unimpressed.</p>
<p>Knol is an interesting example of the tension in Google between its primary mission as a search engine and its competing goal to provide platforms for generating ad revenue. While this new project does not mean Google has turned to content creation itself, I wonder how neutral it will be when it comes time to serve links in its search results. It has been neutral with pages served by two of its other children, Blogger and Google Page Creator. Let‚Äôs hope that trend continues.</p>

			 <p>James Kirchick published a piece called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080312091301/http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=e2f15397-a3c7-4720-ac15-4532a7da84ca">Angry White Man</a> in <em>The New Republic</em> on January 8th. Kirchick waded through some three decades' worth of Ron Paul&rsquo;s newsletters, which he quotes extensively. I do not want to repeat the inflammatory racist and paranoid language he found, but Kirchick&rsquo;s summary of the newsletters' source value bears repeating.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What they reveal are decades worth of obsession with conspiracies, sympathy for the right-wing militia movement, and deeply held bigotry against blacks, Jews, and gays. In short, they suggest that Ron Paul is not the plain-speaking antiwar activist his supporters believe they are backing&ndash;but rather a member in good standing of some of the oldest and ugliest traditions in American politics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Normally I would just ignore a right-wing crank like Paul, but he&rsquo;s been gaining too much respectable attention lately. I&rsquo;ve also seen well-meaning opponents of the Iraq War support him who would be horrified by his decades-long history of racism and fear-mongering. The more blog posts about this subject the better.</p>
<p>Maybe the mainstream media will finally pick up on it for the presidential debates. Who knows? Maybe Ron Paul&rsquo;s fellow Republicans will show some backbone and call him out on this too. Or are they afraid of losing the votes' of Paul&rsquo;s supporters after he loses the primaries? Something needs to happen. As Kirchick writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ron Paul is not going to be president. But, as his campaign has gathered steam, he has found himself increasingly permitted inside the boundaries of respectable debate. He sat for an extensive interview with Tim Russert recently. He has raised almost $20 million in just three months, much of it online. And he received nearly three times as many votes as erstwhile front-runner Rudy Giuliani in last week&rsquo;s Iowa caucus. All the while he has generally been portrayed by the media as principled and serious, while garnering praise for being a &ldquo;straight-talker.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth about this man deserves the widest possible audience.</p>

			 <p>I began blogging in May 2007 with a tumblelog on Tumblr. A tumblelog is a loose collection of images, quotes, videos, sounds, and short chunks of text. I‚Äôve seen the genre compared to a stream of consciousness, although we‚Äôre not talking The Sound and the Fury here. In fact, there is no stream but rather bursts of varying length at random intervals. Hence one journalist has called the tumblelog the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071224141820/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2007/08/23/dltumblelogging123.xml">punk rock of blogging</a>, an apt comparison insofar as tumblelogs are also lean and often undisciplined. But punk offers more coherent narratives than most tumblelogs I‚Äôve seen.</p>
<p>I used my tumblelog for fun and random thoughts, but soon I began blogging for real on Blogger about history and the Mac. The point was to teach and help out. The focus was narrow. My ‚Äúreal‚Äù blog was still my tumblelog, where I put the most interesting tidbits from past and present.</p>
<p>After some six months of blogging, however, I have found that there is much more interest in my blogs than my tumblelog. Part of the reason is that my blogs offer hard information, but my previous post suggests another compelling reason for the lukewarm response to my tumblelog. People with a natural appetite for narrative and an authentic voice leave <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071229131722/http://stoneman.tumblr.com/">my tumblelog</a> amused, perhaps, but still hungry.</p>

			 <p>Some will call me a thankless twit. Invited to spend Christmas week in Davos, Switzerland, I have been miserable for much of the time. I am staying at the Hotel Schatzalp and I have had diner twice at the Steigenberger, luxurious home of the famous World Economic Forum. I am a guest of some very kind people. I don‚Äôt have to‚Äîand couldn‚Äôt possibly‚Äîpay for this vacation. Nonetheless, I am not liking it. The company, food, scenery, and service are all excellent. Attitudes towards smoking, on the other hand, are dreadful.</p>
<p>I used to put up with smoke when I lived in Europe, but things have changed. Some four years ago I came down with asthma. Now I have to worry about more than smelly clothes, burning eyes, and the long-term consequences of second-hand smoke. I have to weigh having an asthma flare-up against offending my hosts. And they don‚Äôt even smoke. I have been drawing the line at hanging out in the smoke-filled hotel lobby, but I could hardly say no to diner on Christmas Eve, which German speakers call Heiliges Abend, the most important family evening of the year in this part of the world. No one was smoking anywhere I could see, but there was smoke in the air. Result: I had to use my rescue inhaler twice after going to bed. Normally I do not need it at all.</p>
<p>Now I have to choose between being outside or hanging out in my room. The outdoor world is beautiful here, as is the view from my room, but sooner or later a body wants coffee or beer‚Äîand company too. I cannot hang out in the beautiful lobby of my hotel, which was built some 100 years ago. I cannot enjoy the ambience of a place made famous by Thomas Mann in The Magic Mountain. I cannot visit my hosts in the Steigenberger. On the other hand, the restaurant in the Hotel Schatzalp is smoke-free, even if I have to hold my breath to get to it.</p>
<p>There is more good news on the horizon. A woman at the reception desk at the Steigenberger was actually sympathetic enough to my problem to tell me that the Swiss canton of Graub√ºnden will go smoke-free in March. Apparently that will be the the second smoke free canton in Switzerland. The first is in the Italian-speaking part of the country. Other parts of Europe with smoking bans include Italy and Ireland, and Germany has a law on the books that will take effect in January. France will also step up its efforts to limit smoking in public places.</p>
<p>I hope these bans work. I enjoy Europe and the company of my wife‚Äôs family, but I am unwilling to give up breathing in order to see them.</p>

<p>Meet Wilhelm Groener, an unassuming Swabian of modest social provenance who rose to the number two position in the Imperial German army by the end of the First World War. Here he is in about 1920, soon after his retirement from the army in the young Weimar Republic.</p>
<p>Groener, the subject of my dissertation, informed Kaiser Wilhelm II in November 1918 that the army would not follow him back to Prussia to fight a civil war to quash the revolution. Confronted with this reality, Wilhelm II abdicated and fled to the Netherlands.</p>
<p>By rights Groener&rsquo;s boss, Chief of the General Staff Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, should have delivered the bad news, but he was a Prussian officer and nobleman, imbued in the traditions of military service to his supreme war lord, the Prussian king and German emperor. Hindenburg did not have the nerve.</p>
<p>Groener was present at the death of another German regime too. He served as minister of defense from 1928 to 1932. Near the end of this tenure he was also acting minister of the interior in the Br√ºning cabinet. In this capacity he pushed to outlaw Hitler&rsquo;s brown-shirts, the S.A., which gave right-wing extremists in the army a chance to withdraw their support of the defense minister and prevail upon President Hindenburg to withdraw his confidence from Groener, who then resigned. Soon the rest of the cabinet did too, and Hitler came to power less than a year later.</p>
<p>Groener witnessed and participated in some of modern Germany&rsquo;s key political events, but that is not what I wrote about in my dissertation. Instead, I focussed on the relationship between his social background and military career, which was interesting precisely because he rose to such prominence in an organization alleged to have been the exclusive playground of the Prussian nobility.</p>
<p>At least that is how my research started.</p>

			 <p>History can be used to justify all manner of circumstances in the present. Want to justify an authoritarian regime in Russia? Referring to Russia&rsquo;s present conditions can help, but even more effective can be skillful tradition-building that shows Russia&rsquo;s long line of great authoritarian rulers. And what better place to start than with history teachers in the schools?</p>
<p><em>The New York Times</em> published <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a remarkable article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> yesterday about a new history guide for high school teachers in Russia. After a brief introduction, it offers verbatim excerpts on Stalin, who comes away smelling like roses, despite his massive purges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stalin followed Peter the Great‚Äôs logic: demand the impossible from the people in order to get the maximum possible. . . . The result of Stalin‚Äôs purges was a new class of managers capable of solving the task of modernization in conditions of shortages of resources, loyal to the supreme power and immaculate from the point of view of executive discipline. . . .</p>
<p>Thus, just like Chancellor Bismarck who united German lands into a single state by ‚Äúiron and blood,‚Äù Stalin was reinforcing his state by cruelty and mercilessness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is quite an intellectual feat to bring Stalin into line with both Peter the Great and Otto von Bismarck. Indeed, such relativism reveals something about the Kremlin&rsquo;s self-image these days. It would be helpful to see the rest of the guide before drawing broader conclusions. Still, does not the following statement recall some of Putin&rsquo;s own criticisms of democracy in the United States in recent years?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Political and historical studies show that when they come under similarly serious threats, even ‚Äúsoft‚Äù and ‚Äúflexible‚Äù political systems, as a rule, turn more rigid and limit individual rights, as happened in the United States after September 11, 2001.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, history textbooks matter.</p>

<p>These stereoptic cards offer a tale of war reduced to two basic elements: soldiers on parade at home followed by the unburied corpses of soldiers on the battlefield. How should we read this story? At first glance, it seems to be about the gap between dreams and reality in war: the transformation of men from objects of admiration in society to a meal for rats, bugs, worms, and microbes in a foreign wasteland. In other words, the pictures seem to tell a story about the utter senselessness of the First World War. But does that interpretation do justice to the lives of these men? Does it tell us why they wore the uniform and sacrificed their lives? Does it tell us about their experience of war? And what about the politicians and generals who sent millions to their deaths? Can we write them off as insane or incompetent fools? Or should we take them seriously and try to fathom their mental universe? Finally, what lasting effects did this violence and loss have on the societies that fought this war? These are some of the questions that inform my interest in military history.</p>

			 <p>When I went to the student coffee shop on Friday, the student at the cash register guessed my order before I could tell him what I wanted. I remarked that I had had similar experiences with regulars when I worked at a Dunkin' Donuts over twenty years ago. His response: &ldquo;They had Dunkin' Donuts back then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For me there has always been a Dunkin' Donuts. Indeed, according to Wikipedia and the corporate website of Dunkin' Donuts, the first store opened in 1950, which is close enough to &ldquo;always&rdquo; for someone born in the early 1960s. So why did the student think Dunkin' Donuts was new? His own answer was eminently practical: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t even been alive for twenty years.&rdquo; Still, his underlying assumption that so much of the world around him was new took me aback.</p>
<p>Maybe I should not have been surprised by his presentism. After all, the current generation of students has grown up hearing that they live in a completely different world than the one into which I was born. They have heard from their parents and teachers about a bygone world in the midst of a Cold War without personal computing, the internet, cell phones, iPods, and global warming. And then there are the many students who have grown up in new subdivisions, schools and strip malls.</p>
<p>What do these thoughts have to do with me and Clio? One of my main goals in undergraduate survey courses is to teach historical thinking, which in part entails helping students appreciate not only that the world has a past, but that the people in that past saw that world through different eyes. But it is not enough for me to ask them to see how the world looks when it is filtered through the experiences of earlier generations. In order to do my job, I find it helps if I meet them halfway and try to understand how the world looks when filtered through their experiences. Of course, I usually end up looking uncool in the process, but as the father of a teenager I am used to that.</p>

			 <p>I was looking through Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt&rsquo;s <em>The Physicists</em>, a play I have used a few times in a survey course on modern Europe. In the back of the English translation by James Kirkup are &ldquo;21 Points to The Physicists,&rdquo; one of which reads, &ldquo;The more human beings proceed by plan the more effectively they may be hit by accident.&rdquo; This quote sums up my recently completed dissertation on three levels that I would like to consider: the content of my research from the point of view of its historical subjects, the path my research takes from my point of view, and the shape of the narrative that eventually emerges. I plan to look at these paradoxes in future posts at irregular intervals. For now I will mention a different one that is not as difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>I spent four years in the U.S. Army during peacetime, and I disliked being a soldier. I also rarely found military history interesting. Nonetheless, my research has focused on war. My M.A. thesis is about Bavarian soldiers and French civilians in the Franco-Prussian War, and my Ph.D. thesis is about the Imperial German officer corps and war planning. How did a former soldier who hated his experience in the military come to enjoy studying military history?</p>
<p>At least part of the answer lies in my military experience. A kid from the woods of New Hampshire had a lot of learning to do in a unit in which most everyone else came from the inner city or rural south. Add class, race, and educational levels to this mix, and I got a first-rate education. You see, I was not just in the army, but combat arms, specifically, the field artillery. When I enlisted I made the naive assumption that the army was the army no matter what one did, and it was offering a substantial bonus for four years in the artillery. So why not? Without going into a longer story, let me say that I left the army in 1987 with an insight of which at the time I was unaware: studying the army can teach a person a lot about that army&rsquo;s country.</p>
<p>Not until I was doing my M.A. in Augsburg, Germany did I realize that I knew this. I think it was late 1992 or early 1993 when I met Professor Stig F√∂rster, who had just returned to Europe from a stint at the German Historical Institute in Washington, DC. Stig was editing <em>On the Road to Total War: The American Civil War and the German Wars of Unification, 1861-1871</em>, and I, as an American there, was recruited as one of his student helpers. I found the topics interesting, because in a seminar I had recently taken with another historian, we had learned about the lead-up to the war and the postwar settlement, but the war just kind of happened. I remarked on this circumstance to Stig. One thing led to another and he suggested I could explore the Bavarians' treatment of civilians in 1870‚Äì71 for my master&rsquo;s thesis. The topic sounded interesting, but also vaguely pornographic. Was it even decent to probe into such suffering? At the same time, scenes from Bosnia on TV suggested to me that such topics mattered. Before making up my mind, I asked if there was an historical treatment of these kinds of issues that might show me the historical value of examining atrocities. That led to Michael Fellman, <em>Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict In Missouri During The American Civil War</em>, as well as James M. McPherson, <em>Battle Cry Of Freedom: The Civil War Era</em>. Of course, I also dug into Michael Howard&rsquo;s perennial <em>The Franco-Prussian War: The German Invasion of France, 1870-71</em>. These books showed me that the study of war was integral to mainstream history and vice versa. With war being fought once again on European soil (the Balkans), I not only was hooked, but I thought such studies were a moral imperative.</p>
<p>Having completed a PhD program and many years of teaching, I no longer see my research in such grandiose terms. Still, I try to integrate at least one lecture on broad trends in war and society into each survey course I teach. I think students need to know that human behavior in war is historically contingent. They need to know, for instance, that humanity and atrocities in warfare have a history. The list is much longer, of course, but I can revisit the topic another time.</p>

			 <p>Do partisan politics have a place in the classroom? No. On the other hand, in a history class it is hard, even impossible to discuss many subjects without politics forming a subtext of the conversation. This difficulty is especially inherent in modern history. How, for example, can we talk about state-building, gender roles, participatory politics, and political ideologies without entering terrain in which we have a personal stake? And once we do that, how do we keep out partisan politics?</p>
<p>The trick is to make that difficult mental leap into the past and try to understand it from the point of view of people who lived in that time. We do not need to take sides with our ideological forefathers, and we do not need to attack their opponents. Nor do we need to respond to problems in the past with solutions from the present. Instead we need to try to think historically. We need to try to understand people in the past in their historical contexts. Making that leap is difficult, but possible.</p>
<p>Ironically, good civic practices are one potential side-effect of cultivating such historical sensibilities. If we can learn to imagine how people thought in the past, maybe we can imagine how our political opponents think in the present. Once we reach that point, a genuine dialog might be possible. The problems might be just as inextricable, but we might learn how to talk with each other instead of at each other. In other words, when we study history, it is possible to acquire the communicative habits necessary for a healthy civic culture. Partisan politics do not belong in the classroom, but the classroom might have some lessons for partisan politics.</p>

			 <p>Writing is hard work for almost everyone, no matter how talented or inspired. Writing is thinking. Good writers do not usually have finished ideas that they then type out. The process of writing and revision is an act of thinking and discovery. That is why writing papers can be so frustrating and rewarding at the same time. Want to improve your prose? Keep a journal, in which you produce a page of text per day. The text can be about anything, but use standard prose, not the kind of abbreviations and lack of capitalization that you might use in informal emails or IMs with friends. The text should also be honest. This exercise is akin to doing regular physical exercise, practicing music, or learning a foreign language. The more you do it, the better you get. The less you do it, the worse you get.</p>
